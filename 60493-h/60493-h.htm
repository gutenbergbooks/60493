    <div>BY WM. M. THALLON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c003'>Read before the Brooklyn Dental Society, May 28, 1888.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. President and Gentlemen</span>:—Some months ago, when sitting
in the operating-chair of your Chairman of the Committee on Subjects,
he asked me if I would not read a paper before the Brooklyn Dental
Society. In the helpless condition in which I then was, with literally
a gag in my mouth, robbing me of the prerogative of free speech, and
under the shadow of a formidable mallet, I somewhat timorously signified
an assent. Under those circumstances I know of few men who
would have had the moral and physical courage to have resisted such
an appeal. When in the course of his further practices, he asked me
what my subject would be, I promptly replied by mentioning the thing
then most vivid in my mind: Facial Neuralgia.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hardly realized my rashness and what I had undertaken, until I
received your printed bulletin of subjects. But it has seemed to me
on further thought that we might perhaps spend an hour profitably
together in comparing notes about that borderland of facts and problems,
which you touch on the one side as dentists and I on the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>as physician. And I trust you will be lenient with me in your judgments
if I go astray in my talk, and I pray you to remember that we
doctors labor under great disadvantages compared with you dentists,
contrasting the width and vagueness of our territory of research with
the precision and accuracy of yours. I have again and again envied
the exquisite dexterity and the certainty of adapting means to ends
which I have seen exhibited by members of your profession, and vainly
longed for the same in my own. But on the other hand, I think it
may justly be urged that the dentists have not contributed as much to
the general stock of knowledge, especially to the solution of disputed
questions of pathology, such as the relation of micro-organisms to disease,
as their unrivaled opportunities for observation would allow.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall therefore not hesitate, Mr. President, to somewhat dogmatically
present my views on certain subjects, but I ask you to believe
it is mainly because I hope the gentlemen present will honor them by
frank and full discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall also ask permission to change the subject of my remarks
from the announced title to one of a little wider scope, namely, Pain,
with special reference to its dental relations.</p>

<p class='c009'>I presume the symptom of pain is the one for which the overwhelming
number of your patients, as the majority of ours, apply to
us for relief. And yet common as this sensation is both in ourselves
and in others, it is very remarkable how little settled opinion is, as to
its nature. If you have never had occasion to try and put into the
form of a definition the idea of pain, and proceed to consult the
authorities, you will be surprised that so many different views could
be held of what at first seems so common and obvious as to be beyond
dispute. As you proceed in your inquiries, the question instead of
becoming simpler apparently becomes more complex, for as you think
of the different forms of pain, and contrast, for instance, that of an
inflamed rheumatic joint, with its definite structural changes and well-marked
constitutional symptoms like fever, with an idiopathic neuralgia,
pure and simple, often lacking in any outward manifestation other
than the pain itself, you wonder if the pains resulting are not as different
as the diseases producing them. But the common consciousness
of mankind which has given the same name to the sensation produced,
whether by an inflamed bowel or a carious tooth, is sure to be right in
believing that there is essentially the same substratum in each. Now
what is the nature of that substratum? It is evident that whatever else
it is, pain is a disagreeable sensation, and the word sensation further
obliges us to remember that it involves a central nervous system (in its
simplest type a single cell), capable of feeling impulses, conveyed to it
from without, or else generated within itself. Now, it is very evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>that pain must consist either in some change in the nature of the
impulses sent to our central cell, or else in some change in the condition
of the receiving centre. So eminent an authority as Prof. Erb
defines pain simply as an increase in the ordinary sensory stimulus, a
heightening more or less intense of ordinary sensation. On the other
hand, Anstie defines pain as a perturbation in the nervous system,
especially of the central cells, involving a lowering of function, a
diminution of ordinary sensation. It is very evident that both of these
great authorities cannot be exclusively right, and I propose to see what
light we could get on this subject from the abundant clinical evidence
you have.</p>

<p class='c009'>This question is no mere quibble about words or definitions, but it
is one of the utmost practical importance in its relation to treatment.
According as we settle in our minds whether a given case of pain is an
exaggeration or a lessening of the ordinary physiological condition,
our treatment will logically be either narcotic or stimulant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving for the present the question as to the nature of pain, let us
examine some of the modes in which it expresses itself; and as far as
practicable I will limit myself to the various pains about the head, for
all the varieties are there manifested.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first point which strikes every observing man is the difference
of individuals in their susceptibility to pain. It is not merely or even
mainly a question of the amount of courage of the patient in bearing
pain, but it is far more a question of inherited or acquired sensitiveness.
The same amount of injury, as nearly as we can judge, in two differently
organized individuals will produce extremely differing degrees of
pain. In general it may be stated that the unduly susceptible individual
has either inherited a weak nervous constitution as regards pain,
or else that some depressing agency has lowered his power of resistance.
When I speak of a weak nervous constitution as regards pain, I
do not mean that it need be a generally weak physique. Perhaps
a more happy word would be unstable. You remember the physicists
talk of bodies being in stable equilibrium when after a disturbance
they tend to return to their bottom, or centre of gravity; while unstable
equilibrium is that state where a little shove off the centre, results in
a big tumble. Now, the people who are markedly susceptible to pain,
who have recurrences of it, may be said to have a nervous system in a
state of unstable equilibrium. In other respects these same individuals
may be splendid types of muscular or mental development.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same condition holds good with pain’s first cousin, muscular
spasm. The analogue to the sensory crisis of attacks of neuralgia is
seen in the muscular convulsions of attacks of epilepsy. And yet
some of the greatest men of the world’s history in mental vigor have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>been epileptics, notably Napoleon Buonaparte and Julius Cæsar.
Although at first we may not be able to see any outward manifestation
of such attacks of pain as I have spoken of, if they recur sufficiently
often they are sure to leave their traces behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we prosecute our inquiries in the other direction, to find what
has predisposed our patient to recurrences of pain, we find in a large
number of cases that his immediate progenitors have suffered from
similar or allied manifestations. By allied manifestations I mean such
other nervous diseases as epilepsy or chorea (St. Vitus’ dance), or insanity.
Moreover, there is one predisposing cause that I believe to
have quite peculiar efficacy, and that is the tendency to phthisis.
Again and again I have verified the truth that where a member of a
tubercular family escapes consumption, he is extraordinarily liable to
develop one of the graver neuroses, preferably recurrent attacks of
pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, the first point we may consider settled, as to the mode in
which pain expresses itself is in an inherited susceptibility, a lessened
power of resistance, and this can only reside in the central nervous
system.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as we have already said, the lessened power of resistance may
be acquired, it need not be inherited.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without stopping to dwell very long on this part of our subject, it
will suffice to enumerate one or two of the principal efficient agents.
And the first and far the most important of these is malnutrition of the
nerve tissues, whether accompanied by the signs of anæmia and general
constitutional malnutrition or not, the main cause being our civilization,
with its excessive nervous wear and tear, no less in the
educational period than in the intense competition of mature life. No
more striking verification of this fact is needed than the results obtained
in the relief of pain by physiological rest, by systematic feeding, especially
of certain kinds of food, particularly fatty food. It is the general
rule that in these cases there is either an indisposition to take
sufficient food, or else that certain necessary ingredients are omitted
owing to the patient’s repugnance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the familiar example of sick-headache, or migraine, the patient
invariably ascribes his condition to a disordered stomach, and scrupulously
avoids such foods as eggs and milk and fat, which he will tell
you always make him bilious. It is the hardest thing in the world to
convince him that he has put the cart before the horse, and that the
real fact is that the nervous trouble, the neurosis of the ophthalmic
division of the fifth, is the cause and not the effect of the gastric disturbance.
I am convinced that much of the suffering in the dental
branches of the fifth nerve can similarly be traced to the nervous malnutrition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of insufficient food, and, in addition, the local condition of
the teeth is pathologically influenced by their not getting their proper
physiological stimulus in the quantity or character of the food to be
chewed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of all the means at our command in combating the neuralgic condition,
the regulating and increase in the quantity of rest and of the
food supply should stand first. These facts have been known and recognized
for a long time; but it is due to an American, Dr. Weir
Mitchell, of Philadelphia, to have intelligently systematized their use.
The principles of his treatment of nervous prostration, spinal irritation,
and allied disorders, in which pain is often a prominent symptom,
consists in a system of rest and forced feeding by which a larger quantity
of nutriment is gotten into the system, and the waste eliminated by
means of artificial exercise, by massage. It is evident that in
this process the increased food absorbed into the blood goes indifferently
to nourish all the tissues; but inasmuch as the muscles are not
the seat of the trouble, if left alone unexercised, they would become
diseased under the very stuffing process. That is where the kneading
and shampooing, and movements supplied from without, are so valuable;
the muscles get their healthy action without drawing on the
forces of the enfeebled nervous system to set the process going. And
so the nervous system has a chance to lie idle and grow fat. Similar
remarkable results have been obtained in another disease whose hereditary
relations to pain I have spoken of, namely consumption, by a
process of forced feeding. The recent results obtained, more especially
in France, by stuffing phthisical subjects, have constituted by far the
greatest advance in the treatment of this disease in recent years. But
in these cases the massage is entirely inapplicable because the waste of
tissue is already too great. The lessons taught by the treatment of
these two classes of diseases are invaluable in combating the more
inveterate forms of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next acquired condition to which I would invite your attention,
which may act as a cause of pain, is the presence of certain
poisonous compounds in the blood or system. These are more
especially the poisons of malaria, of syphilis, of gout and rheumatism,
of alcohol, of certain drugs, and lastly of certain metallic poisons, as
mercury, phosphorus, lead and arsenic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although this group includes a tolerable number of members all
together, it is less important than either the preceding division of nontoxic
malnutrition of the nervous tissues, or of our first class, in which
heredity plays the main role.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still the toxic cases are sufficiently common. What we have already
said as to treatment here holds good, but we must superadd the means
of combating the particular poison.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>In the malarial cases the pain is often entirely relieved by quinine
or one of its substitutes; on this all are agreed, whether homeopaths
or allopaths, or outside of any regular path. It is quite curious how
the malarial neuralgias preferably locate in the first division of the fifth.
But one word of caution, the mere fact of recurrence or periodicity,
more or less regular, does not suffice to establish the diagnosis of
malaria, for all neuralgias are apt to be more or less periodic. You
must get definite symptoms of chill or fever before you can be sure.
Once sure, the treatment is plain: efficient doses of the antiperiodic.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we come to the syphilitic cases we enter more debateable territory.
The pains about the head, especially the teeth, are sometimes
not due to the disease, but to the means taken to combat it. I do not
intend here to take up the question of the treatment of the secondary
stage, except to enter my protest as to the harm done, especially to the
teeth, by routine overdosing with mercury. Fortunately this abuse of
a most valuable remedy is much lessening. In the third stage of
syphilis you sometimes get most remarkable pain manifestations, and
I had one in my practice that I cannot refrain from quoting.</p>

<p class='c009'>A gentleman, aged between 40 and 45, had suffered for years from
recurrent attacks of pain of great severity. When I saw him the pain,
although more or less present constantly, had very marked exacerbations
every afternoon. It was located in the great occipital nerves,
especially on right side. Had formerly had considerable pain in distribution
of right inferior dental nerve. His occupation was sedentary
and involved considerable mental application. He stated on questioning
that some eighteen years before he contracted syphilis. From
this he believed himself cured. He had subsequently married, but
had no children. Having suffered for six or eight years from these
attacks of pain at varying intervals, he had consulted numerous physicians
with only temporary benefit. He was very despondent; his
sufferings were very intense, and only the most powerful anodynes
gave relief. After some investigation, I made up my mind that the
syphilitic dyscrasia lay at the bottom of his suffering. I therefore
began specific treatment with iodide of potash. Prof. Seguin, who saw
him in consultation, concurred in both diagnosis and the line of treatment.
He suggested pushing the iodide until its therapeutic limit was
reached. This was done; but it was not until the enormous dose of
one-half ounce thrice daily was reached that the pain yielded. During
one week this patient took over one pound of iodide of potash.</p>

<p class='c009'>A course of mercury in small doses completed the cure. Two
years have now elapsed, and the patient has had no recurrence of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gout and rheumatism were formerly ascribed a much more important
role in the production of pain than they now occupy. Leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>out of account the acute manifestations of these diseases, their influence
is slight as predisposing causes in the production at least of facial pain.
There is perhaps one disease of the dental apparatus to which I shall
allude later on, in which gout may act as an efficient cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, the class of pains due to the action of the
chronic abuse of certain therapeutic agents is unhappily an increasing
one; I allude to alcohol, opium, cocaine, chloral and other drugs,
originally taken for the relief of pain, which induce a pernicious habit
in their unfortunate victims, of which pain is one of the main expressions.
It is an undoubted fact that this class of sufferers is on the
increase. Much of this tendency is due to the excessive wear and tear
and the unhealthy competition of our modern civilization. It has
always been the refuge of the weak, the attempt to escape from the
moral evils of our lot by means of something that will temporarily dull
our consciousness of the trials we have gone through and the apparently
greater trials that lie ahead of us. The moment the competition
for existence and for wealth becomes keener, the greater will be the
temptation of the unsuccessful or depraved to seek oblivion for their
failure in some narcotic, which will for the time being quiet their disappointed
consciousness. When in addition you have an inherited
weakness on the part of your patient in his susceptibility to pain, or in
a condition of pain actually existing, can you wonder that so many
fall by the way? It seems to me that a terrible responsibility lies upon
us all, especially upon us physicians, lest by our treatment we encourage
this tendency. Nor do I think that as a profession we can be
altogether acquitted of carelessness, to put it mildly, in this regard. It
is so much easier to relieve the symptom pain, when called to a sufferer,
by a dose of morphine, and then when the next attack comes on
to repeat it, than to analyze the complex group of phenomena on
which that pain depends. You will perceive that the question with
which we started as to the nature of pain is of vital importance in this
regard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last group of constitutional agents which act as pain disposers
is one with which you are all familiar, namely, the action of certain
metallic poisons; of these the most important are mercury and phosphorus.
It is highly significant that they have their main action in the
structural changes they cause in the periosteum of bones, the peridental
membranes.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the case of phosphorus, I think it is now pretty generally believed
that its poison has very little effect in the mouth unless there
exist a precedent caries of a tooth or its socket. These facts almost
suffice to take these agents out of the group of constitutionally acting
into that of peripherally irritant causes.  In this class of agents, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the preceding one, the first indication in treatment is the complete removal
of the sufferer from their baneful influence.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now briefly reviewed the main agencies which act constitutionally
in the production of pain. It is apparent, to recur to our
simple illustration, that they must have their main efficiency in the
action they have on the central cell, and not on any modification of
the impulses sent to that cell. It cannot be denied that in rare
instances these various agents are productive of pain referred to a
particular nerve, when we cannot find anything in the nerve itself or in
the tissues supplied by it to account for the morbid manifestation. We
are, therefore, constrained to believe, at least for the present, that morbid
manifestations, sensations of pain, may originate in the cell itself
and thence be referred outward. But I would remind you that the
whole tendency of modern medical thought is to more accurately localize
the starting point of disease, and to circumscribe the area of cases
in which such outward cause of disease is unknown. So long as men
were satisfied to cover up their ignorance in such vague phrases as
“humors of the blood,” “rheumatic diathesis,” etc., etc., few were
tempted to carefully examine the local conditions for an explanation.
But the last fifty years have seen an enormous change in our attitude
of mind to these problems. It is a change which is one of the greatest
in the history of the human mind. And while I do not for a moment
wish to underrate the great importance of a due regard to the constitutional
causes of pain, especially of the malnutrition of the nerve cells,
I believe that in the main they must be classed as predisposing causes
and not as efficient ones. When we come to the question of why pain
is located or referred to a particular nerve, I believe the answer in the
overwhelming majority of cases will be because there is some peripheral
abnormality in that nerve or in some other nerve with which it is
intimately associated; for we have to recognize in the philosophy of
pain the same fact that we do in the philosophy of the human mind,
namely, that our ideas are so closely associated that one thought will
almost necessarily suggest another. Just as, if we have always been
accustomed to see Smith and Jones together, we can hardly think of
Smith without Jones also putting his nose in; so in feeling sensations,
certain ones get so closely intertwined that one will almost inevitably
causes the other. This, then, leads us naturally to the second great
division of our subject, and that is the influence of peripheral irritation
in causing pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>From what I have just said, this may be of two kinds—a reflex or
associated pain expressed in some other nerve than the one affected, or
else it may be due to direct irritation in the nerve itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very common example of the former is seen in the headaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>from which many women suffer, from the menstrual congestion (irritation
of the nerves) of the ovaries and uterus. It is, however, quite
outside the scope of this paper to enlarge on this curious and obscure
part of our subject. I prefer to take up the more understood and
more common form of direct peripheral irritation, and especially the
irritation arising from diseases of the teeth and jaws.</p>

<p class='c009'>In that delightful book, “Rest and Pain,” by Mr. John Hilton,
the eminent London surgeon, he narrates a case, which is so instructive
in illustrating the mode in which peripheral irritation may cause
not only pain, but local disease, that I cannot forbear from quoting it:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gentleman, aged 63, came to consult me about an ulcer situated
upon the left side of his tongue. On examination, I found an elongated,
very ugly-looking ulcer, nearly as large as a bitter almond, and
of much the same shape. The surrounding parts were swollen, hard,
red, and much inflamed, and a lymphatic gland was enlarged below
the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw on the same side. I saw in the
mouth a rugged tooth, with several projecting points upon it, opposite
the ulcer. This gentleman observed to me: “Having suffered a good
deal from earache on the left side for a long time, without experiencing
any relief from medical treatment, it was thought that I must be gouty,
and I went to a surgeon who treats gouty affections of the ear. This
surgeon paid great attention to my ear, but certainly did not do it the
slightest degree of good. I accidentally mentioned to him that I had
for some time past something the matter with my tongue. On seeing
it, he immediately began to apply caustic vigorously; moreover, not
satisfied with applying it himself, he gave it to my wife that she might
apply it at home. I have gone on in this way from day to day, until
the pain in my ear is very considerably increased, and the ulcer on my
tongue is enlarging; so I have come to you for your opinion regarding
my state; for, to tell you the truth, I am afraid of a cancer in my
tongue.” I thought I saw the explanation of this patient’s symptoms.
The pain in the ear was expressed by the fifth nerve, and there was a
rugged tooth with little projections on it, some of which touched a
small filament of the lingual-gustatory branch of the fifth nerve in the
surface of the ulcer. I detected this little filament by placing upon it
the end of a blunt probe. It was situated near the centre of the ulcer,
and was by far its most exquisitely painful part. This exposed nerve
caused the pain in the auditory canal which led him to go to the
aurist, and the aurist, instead of confining himself to his own department,
seized the tongue, put nitrate of silver upon the whole of the
ulcer, and increased the mischief. I simply desired that the ulcer
should be left at rest; that the patient, to avoid touching the tooth,
should neither talk nor move his tongue more than necessary; that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>should wash his mouth with some poppy fermentation, and take a
little soda and sarsaparilla twice a day. In three days about one-third
of the ulcer was healed up, actually cicatrized, the enlarged gland
nearly gone, and the earache much diminished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This rapid improvement might appear something like exaggeration,
but all surgeons know that the tongue has those elements within it
which contribute to the most rapid repair of injury. I do not know
any tissue that repairs itself more rapidly. It is abundantly supplied
with capillaries filled with arterial blood, and has an enormous distribution
of nerves, and these are two elements that contribute to rapid
reparation. It was quite clear that the treatment was in the right direction,
viz., that of giving rest to the tongue and ulcer. After a few
more days I requested him to consult a dental surgeon with respect to
the propriety of taking off the points of the tooth. This was afterwards
done, and the patient soon lost his anxiety about cancer, his
earache, and all his other severe symptoms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot doubt that the starting point of a large number of similar
painful ulcers and of true cancer of the mouth is to be looked for in
disease of the teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we come to the teeth themselves, the pain lies in the irritated
nerves of the pulp. Of course it cannot be denied that the pulp itself
may be the original seat of the pain, but, if so, the number of such
cases must be few. When we reflect on the mode of nutrition of the
tooth, it seems almost self-evident that any depressing agency which
could lead to disease of the pulp must, by an augmented action, cause
greater disease in the structures which depend on the pulp for their
nutrition to start with. At most, disease and pain in the pulp alone
must be nothing less than a pathological curiosity. Such, however, is
not the case in the vast multitude of cases dependent on caries, in
which the pulp has lost in part or in whole its protection from external
morbid influences. The origin of caries is one of the most interesting
subjects in the whole domain of surgery. I have been astonished to
find that among dentists it is not more definitely settled. So able a
writer as Wm. Henry Potter (of Harvard) says: “In the first place, it
may be said that caries of the teeth does not resemble caries of the
bone. The term caries, as applied to the teeth, is a misnomer, given
at a time when the true nature of the process was not understood....
The pathological change which occurs in caries is a decalcification and
disintegration of the several tissues of the teeth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I confess that strikes me as a very excellent description of what
surgeons usually term caries, namely, a molecular death of bone tissue.
Nor can I see any difference in the essential nature of the two processes,
if you make due allowance for the morphological modifications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>tooth structure from bone structure, and the different environment under
which the process takes place. If I were asked to define dental
caries, I should say it was a molecular death of the tooth structures,
especially the dentine, due to the action of micro-organisms; that in
the course of the process lactic or other acid is developed, which decalcifies
the teeth, is doubtless true, but the very presence of acid fermentation
in a normally alkaline cavity necessitates the assumption of the
action of micro-organisms. I would remind you that the conditions
favorable to the activity of such organisms are all apt to be present.
They are:</p>

<p class='c009'>1st. The presence of the micro-organism.</p>

<p class='c009'>2d. The existence of a suitable pabulum.</p>

<p class='c009'>3d. A certain degree of moisture.</p>

<p class='c009'>4th. A certain degree of warmth.</p>

<p class='c009'>5th. A certain amount of oxygen or air.</p>

<p class='c009'>6th. A lessening of the resisting power of the tissues affected, as
compared with health.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of these first five conditions are notoriously present in the
mouth. That we do not oftener suffer from their effects is due to the
absence of our sixth element, the lessening of the resistance of the tissues.
Thus, in health, those organisms which flourish best in an acid
secretion have their baneful activity held in check by the alkaline saliva
as well as the resisting power of the dense enamel. But once let the
alkalinity of the saliva be lessened, or changed to an acid reaction, or
let ever so small an abrasion occur in the enamel, and the myriads of
these agents find a foothold for starting the morbid train of symptoms.
Similarly, even in the tissues themselves, the enamel, no less than the
dentine, suffers from those predisposing causes of constitutional malnutrition,
which are so important in their effect on the central cell, and
which act in lessening the normal resistance of the periphery.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be a work of supererogation to trace the progressive
course of caries and the mechanism of the production of pain through
irritation of the pulp. But when we come to the question of treatment,
the two main considerations to be accomplished are worth our
study; these are: the relief of the pain, and the arrest of the carious
process. The arrest of the pain is what the patient comes to you for,
and prompt action is eminently desirable. I was much impressed
with this in a case I saw a few weeks ago, in which an active business
man, somewhat run down by overworking, suffered from toothache (I
think due to caries) for several days before consulting his dentist, my
friend Dr. Jarvie. The pain in the third division of the fifth nerve
gradually subsided after treatment, but was followed by a well-marked
neuralgia in the great occipital nerve of the same side. He again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>allowed some days to elapse before sending for me, and I found him
suffering from a very intense crisis when I called. It was promptly
relieved by the use of a remedy to which I invite your particular attention,
namely, aconitia.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has seemed to me for some time that this agent should form parts
of the armamentarium of every dentist. From the fact that I have
found it unused or unknown by some of your most progressive men, I
shall not hesitate to say a few words about it to bring it before you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aconitia, or aconitine, is the active principle of the familiar drug
aconite. Although discovered fifty years ago, it is only within the last
ten or twelve years that it has been intelligently used. It is an extremely
potent remedy, and must be used with great caution. In large
doses it acts as a dangerous heart depressor, and paralyzer of motion
and sensation. But in physiological doses it is without danger and is
pre-eminently useful, because of a special action it has in relieving
pain of the fifth nerve. In other neuralgias it is, for some unknown
reason, far less potent. Our excellent Brooklyn pharmacist, Dr.
Squibb, has put upon the market a most reliable preparation of this
drug, an oleate, containing two per cent. of the crystallized salt. This
seems to me a form which is peculiarly adapted to dental work. Ordinarily
in prescribing this remedy internally I begin with <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>200</span></span> of a grain
and repeat it every hour; often one or two doses will suffice to relieve
the pain, and it is seldom that more than four are required.</p>

<p class='c009'>In using it locally if you wished to begin with the same doses, it
would be necessary to dilute one drop of Squibb’s oleate with three
drops of bland oil for each drop of the mixture to contain <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>200</span></span> of a
grain.</p>

<p class='c009'>An application of this medicament would be more effective, I
believe, in relieving the pain of an exposed or inflamed pulp than those
remedies now in use. I can testify from personal experience of the
frequent inefficacy of the local application of oil of cloves and chloroform,
while the use of the stronger remedies, as ninety-five per cent.
carbolic acid or pure creosote, can only be efficacious by more or
less coagulating and therefore in so far destroying the nerve tissue and
the pulp. And this I take it is always to be avoided when practicable.
I hope therefore, that some of you will give this remedy a trial, and
verify practically my suggestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having relieved the pain by one way or another, what means do
you adopt to stop the progress of the caries and restore the tooth as a
useful member of the economy?</p>

<p class='c009'>Now if our considerations as to the origin of caries were true, that
it is a disease due to the agency of septic micro-organisms, the logical
consequence is that successful treatment must be in the line of antiseptic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>treatment. I presume this will cause a smile at the presumption
of an outsider venturing to enter on so practical a subject, and perhaps
some one will mentally quote the line about “fools” rushing in where
angels fear to tread. But it is possible that much of your practice may
have been truly antiseptic, just as the wise surgeon’s has been, long
before we knew the why and wherefore of what experience has now
taught us to be true. We are all more or less like the hero of Moliére’s
comedy, who was astonished to find when he arrived at middle age
that he had been talking prose all his life without knowing it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now if we analyze your proceedings in the treatment of caries, and
thus relieving the painful or inflamed pulp, let us see if they are not
based on antiseptic principles, even though unconsciously employed.</p>

<p class='c009'>First of all I take it you aim to remove all the carious material by
means of your instruments, and the success of the operation is dependent
on the thoroughness with which that is done. Does not that seem
as if you were removing a true infective centre, and thus obviating the
first condition favorable to the development of caries—the presence of
micro-organisms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now let us see how you combat the second favoring condition,
and that is the presence of a suitable pabulum; is not that done by the
simple mechanical interposition of your filling between the diseased
surface and the fluids in the mouth?</p>

<p class='c009'>Again we found a certain degree of moisture needed, do you not
scrupulously dry as well as clean out your cavity, and is not your filler
non-absorbent as far as possible?</p>

<p class='c009'>Fourthly. We found a certain degree of warmth was favorable;
that is, of course, always present in the living body, and in choosing
a good non-conductor of heat as your plugging material, it is with
reference to the secondary effects of caries, the pain caused by thermal
extremes, and not with special reference to the disease itself. Indeed,
could we obtain a substance which would combine the resistance to
organic and chemical action that gold does with the poorness of conducting
power of gutta percha, it would be a great advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The presence of air in the decayed tooth is also prevented by the
mechanical means; while lastly you substitute an artificial tissue to
resist in place of the dentine and enamel that is gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed it seems to be that the whole process of successfully filling
a decayed tooth is one of the most perfect examples of antiseptic treatment
I am acquainted with. I doubt not there will be further advances
made in your technique, but the principles will not change. I believe
it quite likely that it will prove desirable to more thoroughly disinfect
the carious cavity before filling than is always done now, and it may
prove possible to devise some material which, either by its hardness or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>by its chemical constitution, or by some antiseptic incorporated with
it, will longer resist the destruction due to attrition and to chemical
and micro-organic action than the ones now in use.</p>

<p class='c009'>To recur to the main problem of our paper—the relief of pain—is
it not true in this class of cases that after the first effects are stilled, its
recurrence is prevented by affording artificially that immunity to the
pulp from peripheral irritation which it possesses in health?</p>

<p class='c009'>Disease of the peridental membrane causes a characteristic pain,
but one which need not long detain us. From the fact that it is nearly
always secondary and not primary, its treatment should first of all
necessitate the removal of the originating cause. The spread of inflammation
or decomposition from the pulp to the periosteum which so
often occurs can be better accounted for by the hypothesis of the action
of micro-organisms than by any other supposition. Moreover, in the
advanced cases, where pus has formed, the same cardinal indication of
treatment, viz., proper drainage, obtains here as in other departments
of bone surgery.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have already spoken of the constitutional poisons, syphilis and
mercury and phosphorus, which may be causes of this form of trouble,
and I would only like to say one more word, and that is in the way of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Occasionally it has seemed to me that you can stop the further
progress of a periostitis, if you get it in an early stage, and prevent it
from going on to suppuration. I remember one case of a gentleman
who applied to me for a very painful gumboil in his lower jaw opposite
the first molar. The gum was swollen and reddened, and a well-marked
phlegmon could be felt. I gave him fairly large doses of
mercury for a couple of days, and it gradually melted away. There
was no suspicion of syphilis in this case.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another remedy I believe to be of great value in treating neuralgia
of the face starting in periosteal irritation, is phosphorus. The best
form in which to administer this remedy is the preparation known as
Thompson’s solution. I can testify to this from personal experience.
Some twelve years ago I suffered from periostitis of the first bicuspid
of the upper jaw on the right side. A couple of years later, while
working hard, I had an attack of intense neuralgia of the entire second
division of the fifth. When it subsided, it left some periosteal thickening
at the exit of the nerve from the infra-orbital foramen; and ever
since then, whenever I get run down by overwork or worry, the same
pain crops out. But I have found that a few doses of phosphorus will
completely hold it in check; and in one or two patients, since then, I
have seen the same fact, that in the neuralgia due to periosteal irritation
this remedy holds a high place.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>It has seemed to me highly significant that the two drugs, mercury
and phosphorous, which in continued toxic doses cause this very class
of diseases, should in physiological doses be curative. But this is in
entire consonance with the general laws of tissue irritation, and the
therapeutic fact that certain drugs acting through the nervous system
stimulate in small doses and narcotize in large ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last type of dental pain I will speak of is that arising from
pressure due to hypertrophy of the cement. Where this is not due to
the peripheral irritation of a carious tooth, the causation is both interesting
and obscure. It has seemed to me that we must postulate the
agency of a constitutionally acting cause to account for certain of these
cases. I think it quite probable that in certain cases a well-marked
gouty diathesis will be found underlying this form of disease; and a
similar constitutional error must be invoked to explain the allied cases
of calcification of the pulp.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now briefly reviewed the main forms of peripheral irritation,
which act as the efficient causes of dental pain, just as we have
glanced over the main constitutional causes that predispose to it.  I
think you will all agree with me that for the successful treatment of
these cases, especially in the chronic and inveterate type, local and
constitutional treatment have both to be employed.  It seems to me
there is great need for the more intelligent co-operation of physicians
and dentists to attain the best results. Attention to one side of the
question is not sufficient. For the permanent cure of our patients,
the treatment of the local mischief has to be supplemented by attention
directed to the constitutional conditions that predispose to it. One of
the cases I quoted illustrated the important fact that a local irritation
may set up a condition of pain in other nerves which the cure of the
original lesion entirely failed to relieve. This fact is borne out by
many similar conditions which we meet with in other departments of
medicine. On the other hand, while a particular attack of pain may
be relieved by constitutional remedies, its recurrence can only be prevented
by curing the local condition, which acts as the exciting cause.
The enormous preponderance of cases of pain of the fifth nerve, compared
with other nerves, is to be accounted for by the liability of the
delicately adjusted mechanism of the organs supplied to get out of
order. This is especially the case with the eye and the teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is beyond the scope of my paper to take up the various constitutional
remedies of which we can avail ourselves, rest, the influence of
food, the use of the various drugs, the employment of counter-irritation,
of electricity, and, lastly, of those surgical procedures, exsection
and stretching of painful nerves, which are our last resort.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will more than have attained my object if I have pointed out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>however imperfectly, some of the many interesting points at which our
respective fields of work touch. Those points where we need your
help, and you ours, to accomplish the best results.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now, in conclusion, if we revert to our original question as to
what it is that constitutes pain, I think that we will find that both the
great authorities I quoted are wrong, and both are right; each has
stated half of the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>If your observation and reasoning agree with mine, we will be
forced to believe with Anstie that pain in its essential nature consists in
a diminution of the vitality of our central cell, but to further allow
with Erb that this is occasioned, or first brought to our notice in most
cases, by an increase in the impulses sent to that cell by means of
peripheral irritation.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BACTERIA, WITH A METHOD OF STAINING FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY JOSEPH KETCHUM, ESQ.</div>
    <div class='c003'>Read and Demonstrated before the Section on Microscopy of the Brooklyn Institute.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In presenting the subject of Bacteria, I wish to disclaim any originality
for the matter offered. I have endeavored to collect from such
sources of information as I have access to the important dates,
names and facts which have marked the progress of bacteriology up to
the present time.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far as we know, the first observer of bacteria and the so-called
infusoria was Leeuwenhoek, who, with a simple magnifying glass,
noticed in a drop of putrid water the multitude of little granules moving
about in it. This was in 1675, and his observations were communicated
to the Royal Society of Sciences in the same year. In the
following year he recognized bacteria in the tartar from the teeth, and
though he did not name them, his description of their forms and his
drawings enable us to identify them as vibrios. There appears to have
been no important investigations carried on until nearly one hundred
years later, or in 1773, when Müller, a Dane, attempted to classify the
organisms then known. He called them all infusoria, from the fact
that they were the product of infusions, and divided them into two
genera—the monas and vibrio. The monas he subdivided into ten
forms and the vibrio into thirty-five; but his descriptions of them are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>so faulty that it is at present impossible to identify them from his writings.
During the following century the study of bacteriology attracted
more or less attention, and in 1829 Eherenberg, who is the Humboldt
of the science, commenced his investigations, which for fifty years he
pursued with an ardor and enthusiasm second to not even Darwin
himself. He, in 1838, classified the family of vibrioniens, and with
the additions made by Dujardin in 1841, placed them in a scientific
category. Of course during this period many were the disputes and
discussions as to specie, genera or family, each newly discovered member
belonged to. And we have to come to the period of Hallier, Hoffmann
and Cohn, and many others, before the questions, which had
up to that time been in dispute, were settled. Ehrenberg’s original
classification was into:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Bacterium, or rod-like—three species.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Vibrio, snake-like and flexible—nine species.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Spirillum, or spiral, but inflexible—three species.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Spirochœte, spiral, but flexible—one species.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dujardin, in 1841, in his Natural History of the Zoophytes, accepted
the classification of Eherenberg, except that he unites the spirillum
and spirochœte, calling them all spirillum. Up to this time all
bacteria had been considered animals, but a close study of their life
history and habitat by those who followed declared them to belong to
the vegetable kingdom, and as such they are accepted to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1853, M. Chas. Robin pointed out the relationship of bacteria
to Leptothrix, a form of fungi closely allied to that of mildew; and M.
Davaine, in 1868, clearly demonstrated their relationship to the vegetable
world. From this time the progress of bacteriological investigation
has made rapid strides. Prof. Pasteur in the organisms of fermentation
and the role they play therein; Davaine and Hallier in
demonstrating the specific relationship of bacteria with charbon or
anthrax; and the work of Koch, Nageli, Kohn, Bilroth, Miguel, Burdon,
Sanderson, Klein, Weigert, Klebs, Ehrlich, Sternberg, and many
others, are too recent to require special mention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Few have more than the faintest conception of the minuteness of
these organisms. Prof. Cohn, justifying himself for the unscientific
method of comparison which he uses in class instruction by Prof.
Tyndall’s argument on the scientific use of the imagination, says he
compares man to the cheese mite, as the Strasburg cathedral to a sparrow.
Of the animalcules which Leeuwenhoek discovered, they are to
man as the bee is to the horse. As improvements have been made in
microscopes, just so fast have we penetrated into the world of micro-organisms,
until now the proportion between the smallest we can see
and man, is as man is to Mont Blanc.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Of course, with these exceedingly minute structures, nothing can
be made out except points. Among some of the larger forms, a few
have been able to see cellia, and in some cases the growth of the spores;
but in the present state of microscopical optics the work is slow, and
progress in this direction is waiting an advance in the science of
optics.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like all living organisms, bacteria propagate themselves. The
most usual method is by fission or by partition, though Magnin and
Cohn have recorded their observations on the formation of spores and
sporangia, and I have myself witnessed the last named method. It
is of importance to note that while the bacterium is killed by
continued exposure to temperatures of freezing or 176° F., the
spores will germinate after protracted exposure to temperature as high
as 205° F. or as low as °123 F.  These spores will also withstand
complete desiccation, and it is in this form, mixed with the air we
breathe and move in, that present the conditions from which all zymotic
diseases originate.  Miguel has shown that, while the air contains
very few adult bacteria, it contains myriads of their spores. To the
researches of Koch, Pasteur, and others, we are indebted for the certain
information that, while these omnipresent germs withstand such
vicissitudes of temperature, they require certain food for their maintenance;
and though we cannot as yet tell what that food is, we know
that when nutrient material is submitted to their action they thrive for
a time, and when the particular principle which supports them is exhausted
they die. This is particularly true of pathogenic germs, and
the accepted theory of the bacillus tuberculosis, or the germ of consumption,
is a good illustration.  It has been demonstrated by Koch,
Klein, Pasteur, Frankell, Sternberg, and others, that they require some
product of inflammatory action for their support within the body of
their victim. This is also true of cholera, at least so far as their dietary
requirements are concerned. The animal cannot be infected with
tuberculosis by merely introducing the germ-laden material into the
stomach or upon any of the mucous membranes; but if an inflammatory
condition be present, either due to the puncture of the introducing
needle or scalpel, or to extraneous causes, such as a catarrhal condition
of the lungs, tuberculosis is as sure to follow as the sun is to rise
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The human mind can scarcely comprehend the enormous numbers
of these omnipresent atoms without a resort again to the legitimate use
of the imagination. A computation of the increase from a parent germ
shows as follows: We know that the parent grows until it reaches
double its original size, when it constricts itself in the middle like a
figure eight and breaks into two individuals. Each of these divides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>again, and, on account of the rapidity with which this is done, we find
them usually in chains or squares. The warmer the air, the faster this
proceeds, and at the temperature of the body the entire life history of
a germ, from the time of fission of the parent to the time of his own
subdivision into two new individuals occupies less than one hour.
This gives us a known quantity for our problem. Let us look at the
result. From a single germ increasing by the power of two each hour,
we have at the end of twenty-four hours 16,777,220; at the end of
two days the number has increased to 281 billions, and in three days
to the enormous number of 48 trillions, and in one week the number
can only be expressed by figures of fifty-places. In order to make this
number comprehensible, let us figure the mass and weight of this, the
result of a single bacterium. A single Bacterium Termo has an average
width of <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1,000</span></span> mm. A cubic mm. would therefore contain six
hundred and thirty-three millions, and in one day would be one-fortieth
full. At the end of the following day there would be required
444,570 such cubes to contain the product of the parent, or say half a
litre. Suppose the seas of the earth cover two-thirds of its surface with
a mean depth of one mile, the aqueous product would be 929 million
miles. Now, our parent germ and its product would in five days completely
fill this space. More wonderful still is a gravimetric estimation.
Suppose we call the specific weight of the parent germ the same
as water, which cannot be far from right, it would appear that the
parent weighs, or his equal bulk of water weighs, 136 millionths of a
gramme; in forty-eight hours, 442 grammes; in three days, nearly
7½ million kilograms; and, inside of thirty days, the weight of the
earth itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prof. Cohn, in offering these figures, says: “I don’t consider this
idle play; without it we can form no conception of not only the enormous
increase, but the tremendous destruction of these germs which is
going on around us. Food is lacking to support more than a comparatively
small proportion of the product of the parent, and, as it is
demonstrated that they feed from their environment, one can readily
understand that without a constant supply a given infectious germ will
with its followers soon destroy its nidus or perish from starvation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our breweries demonstrate the truth of this hypothesis; for, in
twenty-four hours, a single yeast cell, which is <span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='vincula'>1,000</span></span> mm. in diameter,
will yield one hundred-weight of yeast.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have endeavored to present the subject in a condensed but general
way without burdening you with technical details of species,
genera or life history. The subject is a vast one and to which the
best minds of the scientific world are devoting themselves. To those
who are or may become interested in bacteriology and particularly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>those who study the relation of these germs to disease, is held forth the
reward which is sure to come to those who work persistently and intelligently.</p>

<p class='c009'>The method which I shall employ to-night is eclectic. Doubtless
each investigator will find fault with some parts of the process and
perhaps suggest a better one. The following, however, has in my
hands worked well and given entire satisfaction, so far as I know, to
those who were and are most interested.</p>

<p class='c009'>The apparatus necessary is as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>One two-inch glass funnel.</p>

<p class='c009'>One package filter papers to fit same.</p>

<p class='c009'>Four medium size test tubes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two glass or porcelain staining glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>One glass or agate mortar and pestle.</p>

<p class='c009'>One cover holder.</p>

<p class='c009'>One pair pincetts.</p>

<p class='c009'>One alcohol lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>Package of wooden toothpicks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cover holder may be easily made by taking a piece of thin
platinum, two inches long and one-eighth wide, splitting one end for
half an inch up and bending into a Y shape, then lashing to a small
handle (I use a match). This little tool is most convenient for floating
cover glasses in staining fluids.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reagents necessary are as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>A five per cent. solution of nitric acid in alcohol (95 per cent.).</p>

<p class='c009'>Saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Saturated alcoholic solution of methyl blue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Small quantity of alcohol, 80 to 95 per cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pure colorless aniline oil (anilin).</p>

<p class='c009'>The method is as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>First pour enough aniline into a test tube to cover the bottom and
half fill with water, shake violently for two minutes, and filter through
funnel, which has previously had wet filter paper fitted. It is essential
that the filter paper be saturated with water, else the aniline oil will
separate during filtration. Our next step is to deposit specimen of
sputum in mortar (if very viscid, add a few drops of water), and triturate
thoroughly in order to break up encapsulated colonies, and distribute
evenly through the specimen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now remove an amount which will just cover end of toothpick,
and deposit it on a previously cleaned cover glass, which should not
be over <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>100</span></span> inch thick, and thinner if possible; immediately cover with
another cover glass, allowing sputum to spread by capillarity or slight
pressure, and separate by sliding apart, and put aside to dry without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>heat. I have found that specimens dried without heat (and consequent
coagulation of albumen) will show a much larger number of
bacilli than when heat is used. I believe this is due to the fact that the
fuchsine penetrates more thoroughly through the albumen when not
coagulated, or that when it is coagulated by heat it to a greater or less
extent it protects them from the action of the stain. While the covers
are drying we will pour out a sufficient quantity of the aniline water,
which by this time has filtered into one of the staining glasses, and add
one or two drops (not more) fuchsine solution. Now, placing one of
the cover glasses on our cover holder, sputum side down, we lower it
into the staining fluid and withdraw holder from the side, and repeat
the operation for the other cover glass. It is my habit to allow the
covers to remain in this solution for at least eight hours or over night.
The time may be reduced to ten or fifteen minutes by heating the red
stain to about 140 or 150 F., but the result is not so brilliant, nor is it
sure, as I have frequently failed to find the bacilli by the short method,
but have been able to demonstrate their presence by the long one.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of either of the above periods of time, the cover glass is
lifted out of the staining solution and, without washing, immersed in
our five per cent. solution of nitric acid and alcohol. It is this part of
the process, if any, which will give trouble, as the time of immersion
is governed by the thickness and general character of the sputum. My
custom is to hold the first cover immersed until the color has just disappeared,
or say fifteen seconds, and the second five seconds longer;
but a very little experience will remove any difficulty from over-decolorizing.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the decolorizing solution they are immediately immersed in
water and thoroughly washed, when they may be again floated in the
contra-stain, which is prepared by filling the other staining glass with
water to which a few drops (three or four) of our methyl blue has been
added. They should remain here for from five to eight minutes, when
they are again removed with the pincetts, and a few drops of alcohol
poured over them to wash off the surplus stain. Again wash in clean
water, and dry by gentle heat (which will now do no harm) over the
alcohol lamp, and place sputum side up on table.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very small drop of thin benzole balsam is now placed in the centre
of each cover, and a cleansed slide gently lowered over one in such
a position that both covers may be mounted on a single slide. As
soon as the slide has been sufficiently lowered to come in contact with
the drop of balsam, it spreads by capillarity, and draws the cover close
to the slide without the slightest danger from air bubbles being engaged,
and the slide may at once be inspected by a <em>dry</em> objective.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have found it necessary to use an objective at least as high as one-fifth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>or one-sixth, with central illumination without diaphragm, as cases
will frequently occur where the staining is so faint, that with a lower
power they will escape observation, though a good, wide angle, four-tenths
inch, will show them well when strongly stained.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have endeavored to explain the method with perhaps too strict a
regard to detail, but am sure that one who follows the various steps
once or twice cannot fail to acquire the necessary technique without
occupying more than fifteen minutes of working time; that is to say,
five minutes to the first staining, and then the following morning to prepare
and mount for observation.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ADDRESS TO THE GRADUATES OF THE LONG ISLAND COLLEGE HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES, DELIVERED JUNE 12, 1888.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY GEORGE G. HOPKINS, A.M., M.D.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Ladies and Gentlemen and Class of 1888</em>: We are apt to claim the
trained female nurse as the outcome of the more rational treatment of
disease, in modern times, but this is wide of the truth. So far as I
can ascertain, in my researches among the ancient Vidas of Hindostan,
and the literature of Egypt, Greece and Rome, I find no allusion to
female nurses as a class, until the third century of the Christian era.
Surgery and medicine had attained a high degree of perfection, many
operations which to-day we claim as new to the nineteenth century
were successfully performed 4,000 years ago; but the special nursing
of them seems to have been done by the medical student, or by the
practitioner himself. The earliest record I can find of women devoting
themselves to the care of the sick, and attending to all the duties
of a trained nurse, is that of Empress Helena, mother of Constantine
the Great. This noble woman, who lived nearly fifteen hundred years
ago, not only founded a hospital and endowed it, but herself, with the
ladies of her court, there gave the most devoted and tender care to the
sick poor. The Emperor Valens presented the most beautiful grounds
and buildings in the neighborhood of Cæsarea to Archbishop Basil,
“for the benefit of the poor whose bodies were afflicted with disease,”
as being those who stood most in need of assistance. And as early as
A. D. 373, the Archbishop had organized at Cæsarea an immense hospital,
called the “Basilides,” which Gregory Nazienza thought worthy
to be recorded among the wonders of the world; so numerous were
the poor and sick who came thither, and so admirable was the care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and order in which they were served. The charge of these sufferers
was not at first assigned to humble hands; the most illustrious ladies
of the empire participating in the offices of mercy.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Constantinople the Empress Flacilla, wife of the elder Theodosius,
in the year 380 was watching with solicitude over all those whose
bodies were mutilated, or who had lost limbs. She visited them in
their own dwellings, waited upon them herself, and supplied their
wants. She repaired with the same zeal to the public hospitals of the
church, where she attended the sick, made ready their culinary utensils,
tasted their broth, carried the dish to them, broke the bread,
divided the meal, washed the cups, and performed for them all the
offices which usually devolve upon servants. One might justly be
proud to be in such royal company, and regard, as she did, nothing
degrading which is necessary to be done for a sick patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>In modern times, the revival of nursing by trained women is due
in great measure to that noble and accomplished woman, Florence
Nightingale. As early as 1844, at the age of twenty-one years, she
began to exhibit her interest in and the alleviation of suffering, and
the improvement of the care of the sick poor in the hospitals of Great
Britain. She visited and inspected the hospitals of Europe, and in
1851 entered into training as a nurse, in the institution of Protestant
Deaconesses, at Kaiserworth on the Rhine. On her return to London
she put into thorough order the Sanitarium for Governesses, in connection
with the London Institute. She served ten years of apprenticeship
before entering on her life work.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the spring of 1854 war was declared with Russia, and an army
of 25,000 men was despatched to the Crimea. The faulty arrangements
of the British government for the care of the sick and wounded
furnished the theatre in which Florence Nightingale was to win her
first laurels. The hospitals were soon crowded, and the mortality in
the wards so great that the casualties of the fiercest battles were as
nothing in comparison.</p>

<p class='c009'>The war office recognizing the condition of affairs, gladly accepted
the offer of Miss Nightingale to go to the seat of war and organize a
nursing department.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her devotion to the sufferers can never be forgotten, she has stood
twenty hours at a time, directing and assisting in the care of the sick
and wounded. Her unfaltering devotion and incessant work undermined
her health; but though sick and feeble, she never left the field
of duty until Turkey was evacuated by the English troops. Major
Delafield (who with Maj. Mordecai and Capt. Geo. B. McClellan,
U. S. A., had been sent to Europe by our government, to study the
art of war in the Crimea), in his report to the War Department,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>remarks, in speaking of the English hospital at Scutari, “It was in
this well-arranged hospital that that most estimable lady, Miss Nightingale,
exercised her powerful influence in alleviating the condition of
the sick and wounded from the battle-field. Women as nurses were
employed to attend upon the men in the wards, under the kind and
beneficent guardianship of this good lady, with the many advantages
that would naturally follow the most gentle, painstaking, and cleanly
attendance of women as nurses. Miss Nightingale’s efforts have resulted
in the establishing, in connection with the English army, an
office known as the ‘Superintendant General of Army Nurses,’ the
office to be always filled by a woman. She has under her a corps of
female nurses, who take care of the sick in the military hospitals.”
The Sanitary and Christian Commission of our late war was the outcome
of the volunteer nursing in the English war of the Crimea and
the fruit of these efforts in this country are the training schools for
nurses which have sprung up all over this land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to our entrance into this world and our departure from it,
occasions such as the present, when we have completed our education
and are about to enter upon our chosen vocation, are the most important
events in our lives. The calling which you have chosen, while
not a new one, is comparatively new in having special schools, and
courses of study provided for it. Nursing has always been considered
peculiarly woman’s work—more or less adaptation to such work is inborn
in woman. What man can smoothe the pillow of the sick, or
soothe an aching brow as gently and acceptably as one of the gentler
sex! Who can move as quietly, and approach the bed of pain so
gently as woman!</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen sick men, absent from home and friends, sigh for a
mother, sister, or wife who is not at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thanks to this school, and others, everyone can now have skilled
female care when sickness and disease are upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>You who are about to go out from us to-day, are entering upon a
calling which will require all the skill, faithfulness, courage, patience,
forbearance, endurance, watchfulness, self-possession, tenderness,
cheerfulness and tact, that a human being can possess, and above all,
“a conscience void of offence toward God and man.” “To thine
own self be true, and it doth follow as the night the day, thou canst
not then be false to any other.” You have each and all of you received,
at the hands of your admirable Superintendent, and the lecturers
of the College, such definite and varied information in all the
departments in which you may be called to act, that you ought to be
prepared for most emergencies, and have shown by your examinations
that you have heard and understood them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The fault will be yours, and yours alone, if you do not treasure
them in your minds, so that you may be not only trained but <em>skilled</em>
nurses. The responsibility for the proper management of a sick-room
and the patient in it is a very high and grave position, and requires
the utmost faithfulness on the part of the nurse. Unless you are willing
to put aside everything that may interfere with your giving <em>yourself</em>
entirely and conscientiously to the care of your patient, do not assume
the charge. But when you once receive that charge remember that
you are dealing with that which disease can destroy by your negligence,
and no human power can restore—a precious human life. You
therefore owe to each case all that a faithful mind can suggest and
the body endure; and such faithfulness has not been wanting in the
former graduates of this school.</p>

<p class='c009'>I can never forget the scene when one of our graduates, after having
charge of over thirty cases of typhoid fever among some orphan
children, and we had to lose one, whom she had nursed as faithfully
and tenderly as its own mother could have done, how, when she had
done her all and death claimed him, there were tears shed for one who
had no mother to shed them. And it was due largely to her unremitting
faithfulness that we were able to record but two deaths in thirty-three
cases. That woman has not had an idle day to my knowledge
in several years.</p>

<p class='c009'>When any unexpected emergency arises, which to your educated
eye teaches you that your patient is in extreme danger, do not alarm
the friends unnecessarily; try not to show in your voice or conduct
that you are demoralized and have lost courage. While doing
the best you can (until the arrival of the physician, whom it was your
first duty to have summoned), encourage those around you, and keep
them busy if you can, as, unless they are occupied, the coming of the
physician will seem to them unreasonably delayed, even though he be
at hand when called. Above all, do not let every physician within
reach be sent for, unless the situation is one of great urgency, as I
believe many patients have been frightened to death by the demoralization
of solicitous friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you can show yourself capable and maintain your own composure
of mind, you will be able in nearly every instance to avert a
panic, and in many cases prevent disastrous results to your patient.
But if you fail at times for want of proper courage, do not give up with
a feeling that you are unequal to emergencies, only be the more
determined not to show the white feather again.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a well known fact to military men, that veteran troops who
have stood the brunt of the fight in many a battle, become demoralized
unexpectedly and retreat, to the utter surprise of their officers. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>their next battle their courage and deeds of prowess again surprise
every one. So be it with you.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the sick-room nothing so distresses the helpless sufferer as a
want of frankness on the part of the attendant. You may refuse or
neglect to answer, or turn the subject if possible, but never tell what
are called “white lies.” One lie always requires another to cover it,
and sooner or later you will be caught. If it is not best to tell, say
outright it is better for me not to answer that question; or it may be
the least of two evils to answer it faithfully as patients often imagine
that things are far worse than they are. I believe that we of the medical
profession often err in withholding from patients that which it is
best in the end that they should know. This is one of our most
difficult lines to draw.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have not learned or are not determined to learn to endure
the caprices and demands of unreasonable men and women in the
most unreasonable hour of their lives, you have mistaken your calling;
as without Christian patience, I do not believe it possible for a nurse
to succeed for any length of time. The trials and vexations of a
nurse’s life are so numerous and so constant, that it is a wonder to me
that there are so many who are ready to enter this calling in life.
There is no need since the revival of professional nursing for women
to torture themselves or do penance. Be as ready to minister to disagreeable
people as a person who two years ago wrote that she would
take a fresh air child, saying “send me one of the dirtiest, most unattractive
and unruly of the children, one whom nobody else wants.” An
unreasonable, selfish and wilful patient is a purgatorial discipline for
both nurse and doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remember that the most gentle and considerate of people will say
and do things when sick unwittingly, that in health they would sooner
cut out their tongues or destroy a limb than say or do. The mind is
sick as well as the body, and the patient not responsible. Cultivate
forbearance and endeavor to sear all your tender points. Be ever ready
to excuse and believe that no slight was intended, unless it is reiterated
and you are forced to believe it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The physical and mental strain which you are at times called to
bear will be very great; that you may be able to endure it, you must
give special care to your health. You have been taught the laws of
health, and yours is so arduous a calling you must observe them strictly.
Dame Nature is a stern mistress, and if you disobey her you will surely
suffer for it. When you are out of employment you will need recreation
and diversion to keep both body and mind in the best condition.
When you are in charge of a patient, the time away from the bedside
is not yours to do with as you please, but for rest and fresh air; as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>you owe it to your patient to give the best possible service, and thus
only can you do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must cultivate the habit of observing the least change in your
patient’s condition, so as to be ready to meet any emergency; it will
not do to sit down and watch your patient as a cat would a mouse.
Yet in severe cases your eye should hardly ever be off your patient;
this should be accomplished and can be done in such a way as to be
almost imperceptible to the sufferer. Every little change should be
noted, and if any importance may attach to it, it should be written
down as soon as you can conveniently do so. You are the physician’s
eyes, ears, and hands while he is absent; you cannot therefore
be too watchful.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each one of us has certain vulnerable points of character, but it is
not always easy for us to see them. If we would be self-possessed we
must seek to discover these weak points in our armor by seeing ourselves
as others see us; then by learning how to cover them, and not
be disconcerted when our weak point is attacked. No <em>one</em> virtue is of
more value in your arduous calling than this one of self-possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this world of care and trouble much can be done to ameliorate
suffering and soften the sting of pain by tender, sympathetic care;
your patients will expect less of you if all you do is done with ease
and quietness and thoughtful tenderness. You will then be likely to
gain a friend in every patient; the patient will feel that a friend has
gone when you depart.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cheerful character rides smoothly over many rough places in this
world that otherwise would jolt terribly. A bright, cheery nurse is
better than many a dose of medicine for the patient; therefore be
always cheerful. By cheerful I do not mean frivolous, as levity is the
last thing that should appear in a room where such mighty elements
are at work as in the sick-chamber. Therefore be cheery, but not
mirthful or giddy.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are some words in the dead languages which it is almost
impossible to put into English without, in a great measure, losing their
meaning because they contain so much in themselves; they are so
difficult to define. So there is one little word in the English language
that contains so much in itself that it is impossible to define it in a few
words, and after using many you feel that you have only sailed around
it without getting at the central and most important part of it—that
word is <em>tact</em>. But it is the want of that which has consigned some of
the brightest and noblest minds that I have known to oblivion. I call
to mind just now one of the best read and most highly cultured and
gifted men that the medical profession of Brooklyn has ever known.
He lived and died among us, unappreciated except by the few who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>knew him best, little sought after by those who needed balm for their
diseases, which he was better able to apply than most of his companions,
and with scanty maintenance, while medical sky-rockets about
him were riding into lucrative practices. The suffering continued to
suffer, when, if they had only known it, skilled and efficient help was
at hand, in a man who did not know how to so bear himself as to
win the confidence of the community. Had he possessed a little tact
his name would have been known to the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>I want to say to each one of you, consider well if you propose to
follow this arduous calling, pause and consider whether you really
feel that it is your vocation, and feel equal to its physical and mental
demands.</p>

<p class='c009'>An ideal to strive after is good for us all. I will lay before you
to-night one that was realized in the history of a friend who is now in
a better and happier clime than this, and whom I would be glad to
have each one of you strive to emulate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some years ago, before, as far as I know, there were any trained
nurses in this city, I was asked to go to see a lady in a neighboring
village, who had been confined to her bed for more than a year, and
was supposed to be incurable. A year from that time she was able to
be about, and six months later she determined to devote her time to
the care of the sick poor. She did so, and I never had any one who
would, or could, take better care of every case that fell to her charge.
I always felt that, as far as human skill and strength could do it, my
directions would be carried out to the very letter. Her last case was
that of a little girl who had been burned over about three-quarters of
her body, a degree of burning usually considered fatal; but in this
case it did not prove so; and for months this noble woman dressed
this suffering child, and would let no one else do it. Little Tina
dreaded to have any one else touch her. The child was almost well,
and this good woman was just finishing her morning dressing of the
burn, when she suddenly fell back and expired. The soldier died at
her post of duty.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>THE ETHICS OF OPIUM HABITUES.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY J. B. MATTISON, M. D.,</div>
    <div class='c003'>Read before the Society of Medical Jurisprudence and State Medicine, June 14, 1888.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“All men are liars,” said the writer of ancient days, and the revised
version of modern times is, “All men—who take opium—are liars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The writer—whose initial acquaintance with this question dates
back nearly two decades, and whose professional experience for several
years has been exclusively devoted to a large and enlarging clientele
of this class—has long held this opinion to be a mistaken one.
Years ago he wrote—“Clinical Notes on Opium Addiction,” read
before the Kings Co. Med. Soc., 16th January, 1883—“Nor do we
share in the opinion, largely held, that no reliance is to be placed on
the word of opium habitués. That the habitual use of opium, in many
cases, does exert a baneful influence on the moral nature we are well
aware, but we also know that in the ranks of these unfortunates are
those who would scorn to deceive, and whose statements are as worthy
of credence as those upon whom has not fallen this blight.” Increasing
attention to this topic has only confirmed that belief, and the
recent statement—unwarranted and untrue—of a medical writer and
teacher, that “no morphia habitué can be depended on to tell the
truth,” with the courteous invitation of your honored President to present
you a paper, has prompted me to offer some thoughts on this
subject—the result of observation, reflection and applied common
sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>Putting the query—why do men take opium?—the answer to-day
is that made nearly twenty years ago by Dr. Joseph Parrish, Pres.
Amer. Assoc. for the cure of Inebriates—“men take it for a physical
necessity.” In an experience covering the history and treatment of
hundreds of cases, I have noted only two exceptions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let it be distinctly understood that my remarks apply only to the
better class of habitués, who have become such by force of conditions
beyond control. With those who, viciously indulgent and lacking
alike in principle and purpose, take opium from mere sensual desire,
we have nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>This physical necessity, the great genetic factor in an opiate using,
it need scarcely be said, has its rise in painful disorder of body
or mind. For this opium in some form is given, which, when the
legitimate need for its action is ended, entails a demand for continued
taking that will not be denied.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The larger share of responsibility then rests on the medical man
who prescribes—very properly it may be—this valued drug, though
the main measure of his responsibility depends not on the initial
using, but upon the case being dismissed without full thought as to
the ultimate result of the opiate taking, and with a neglect to warn
the patient against the danger of continued using, and insisting upon—giving
to this his personal attention—the entire narcotic disusing
when the proper need for its taking is ended. Vide “The Genesis of
Opium Addiction,” <cite>Detroit Lancet, 1884</cite>, and “The Responsibility of
the Profession in the Production of Opium Inebriety,” <cite>Med. and Surg.
Reporter, 1878</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Granting this correct, on what principle of equity or right can one
be held accountable, and so culpable, for his use of the drug when,
unaware of its ensnaring power, and, confiding in the counsel of his
medical adviser he avails himself of the relief it affords?</p>

<p class='c009'>Another and most important auxiliary factor obtains in these cases—one
of which the laity knows little or nothing, and the profession
appreciates less than it should—and that is the power opium possesses
to create a necessity of its own. Of this, I venture to assert that no
one, other than the subject of a painful personal experience, or of
large observation, can form a fully adequate idea. The writer has
been studying opium and opium habitués for more than sixteen years,
with an annual experience, of late, as regards number of cases, that is
probably unequalled in this country, and yet he stands more and more
in awe of this peculiar power with every case that comes under his
care.</p>

<p class='c009'>Granting a painful physical necessity, and the daily or semi-daily
use of opium—especially morphia, subcutaneously—for a few weeks
or months, and there are few, if any, who can withstand the ensnaring,
enslaving power of this drug. Men stronger of brain and brawn than
we have gone down before it. I have known a superbly athletic
specimen of physical manhood, able to resist the wintry rigor of a
polar expedition, succumb to the power of morphia in less than a
month. I have seen a man so generously endowed that he survived
the horrors of Salisbury when the death rate averaged eighty per cent.,
go down before the same resistless power in four weeks. It was my
pleasure to see this gentleman recover, and take the lecture platform
to tell of his bondage and escape, and this is what he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I proclaim it as my sincere belief that any one afflicted with neurotic
disease of marked severity, and who has in his possession a
hypodermic syringe and morphia solution, is bound to become, sooner
or later, if he tampers at all with the potent and fascinating alleviative,
an opium habitué. The first dose is taken, and mark the transformation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>This overmastering palliative creates such a confident, serene,
and devil-may-care assurance, that one does not for once think of the
final result. The sweetness of such harmony can never give way to
monotony. Volition is suspended. You may not think of it when
the pain for which it was taken subsides. But when distress supervenes
you go at once for the only balm that abounds in Gilead, and
every additional dose is but another thread, however invisible, of which
the web is made that binds us fast as fate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If this be true—and it is true—what justice is there in the charge
that these unfortunates continue the use of opium from an innate propensity
to evil, or a merely vicious desire? What right have we to
set ourselves up in judgment to note the beam in our brother’s eye,
when the only reason it is not in our own—when the only reason you
and I are not opium habitués—is because a kind Creator has so conditioned
us that this physical necessity, and consequent opiate need,
does not, with us, obtain?</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus touched upon the etiology of this disorder, let us
reason together regarding the special ethical point involved, and note
the reason—if reason there be—for the commonly accepted idea that
all men who use opium are liars. While admitting that the habitual
need and use of this drug does, in many cases, warrant such assertion,
I hold that the leading factor in this moral obliquity is the principle of
self protection—the habitué’s desire to shield himself from that censure
which the prevalent opinion—uncharitable and untrue—that he is simply
the victim of his own vicious indulgence, involves.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are various proofs that this holding is correct, and, too,
without resorting to the opinion held by Lahr, Fiedler, and some
others, that opium habitués are the subjects of a mental alienation,
both in the creation and continuance of their addiction, and therefore
absolved from culpable wrong—an opinion in which I do not share.
Nor do I believe, for reasons given, with another German observer,
that “the morbid craving for morphia ranks among the category of
other human passions, such as smoking, gambling, greediness for
profit, etc.,” for if this were true, the impulse to protect one’s self
would not so largely prevail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The opium habitué realizing that he is looked upon as one who
has given himself up to a vicious habit, a habit in which he persists
from mere desire to enjoy the pleasures of opium—pleasures which,
be it ever remembered, soon give place to its pains—and so liable to
the censure which a vicious indulging involves, is impelled—by a feeling
common to us all of guarding our good repute—to yield to the
protective temptation to untruth.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to this there are numerous exceptions, for many a captive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>this drug, though well nigh crushed by his captivity, and that “cruelty
of ignorance,” which the unjust reproaches of should-be friends entails,
still refuses to seek refuge behind such subterfuge, and scorns to tell a lie.</p>

<p class='c009'>And do we not note this same impulse to deceit in most non-habitués
who, lapsing from the right, make effort to avoid the sequence
of their sin? Does the swindler always confess his swindling? Do
the thieves, the forgers, the rascals of any degree, never deny their
wrong doing? And while, in these cases, such double wrong may be
the outcome of a general depravity, that, of itself, tends to prove that
if the pernicious effect of opium in this regard were due solely to its
baneful effect upon the morale in general, we should note the same
tendency to lying along the various lines of life, whereas, it is a fact
that on any question other than one involving his opiate taking, and
consequent accountability, the habitué may be, and often is, a very
prototype of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is the bearing of this question on the medico-legal status of
these cases? If they be held culpable for the inception and furtherance
of their condition, whatever outcome there may be affecting the
jurisprudence of their action, must, from such erroneous view of the
situation, fail of that legal justice which a correct appreciation of their
case demands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The writer was recently called upon to testify in the case of a
physician who had been under his care for treatment of narcotic
inebriety. This gentleman was the subject of delusions and hallucinations,
so marked, that, in my opinion, he was not accountable for his
conduct. Suit for separation was brought against him, and the referee’s
remarks during the trial, and his final decision, were in keeping
with the belief that the defendant was responsible for the consequences
of his alienation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, a right appreciation of the status of such patients will lessen
the labors of the doctor and the lawyer in their legal aspect, and
remove the risk of failure to determine the true physical condition of
the habitué where the question of narcotic taking is the leading issue
in the case. To illustrate. Granting a general acceptance of my
assertion that the class to which this paper pertains are the subjects of
a disturbed organism, beyond their control, and for which they are
blameless; and granting an appreciation of this belief by the patients
themselves, then their main motive for concealment will be removed,
and no more reason for untruth exist than if they were the victims of
any other functional disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, the present general opinion of these patients is such that
once a case comes into court to settle the question of an opiate using,
the defendant, desirous of protecting himself, by denying his drug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>taking, makes it essential that evidence be secured to disprove his
statement, and if certain signs be wanting, the habitué may quite outwit
the medical expert. The writer noted a case of this sort last
summer. A lady, cultured and refined, who had fallen a victim to
morphia years before, and who was party to a suit in court, was examined
by two well-known female physicians of this city, who, failing to
apply the one infallible test of an opiate using, testified that she was
not an habitué. They were mistaken—the lady was taking morphia,
though she has since recovered. The point involved, to spare the
chagrin of such an error, is obvious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly, what is the trend of a more rational view of this question as
regards the treatment of these cases? Reference has been made to the
statement that “no morphia habitué can be depended on to tell the
truth”—a statement so often at variance with the fact that it must be
the outcome of an experience with the baser class of cases—and I
submit the wrong of regarding <em>all</em> as liars because <em>some</em> fail to tell the
truth; or, added evidence of the “cruelty of ignorance;” or, an
unwarranted libel on a worthy class of unfortunates, who, Heaven
knows, have enough to bear without loading them with the reproach
such an injustice implies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless it is just such an opinion, and consequent lack of
confidence in the honor of these patients that influences their management
by some medical men. Looked upon as the victims of their own
wrong-doing, or as unworthy the sympathy that should ever exist
between physician and patient, or treated on the erroneous belief that
such is the only proper method, they are consigned to the brutal ordeal
of abrupt and entire opiate disusing, which, while it may end in the
desired result, entails such suffering of mind and body as to be utterly
inexcusable—because a more humane method will avail—except under
conditions peculiar and beyond control.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am well aware that such coercive measures are the only hope of
cure in some cases, but I also know that such patients are not of the
better class, and that, once the drug abandoned, the prospect of continued
recovery is small, because they lack one of the essential requisites
for a permanently good result—that is an earnest desire to be
cured.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the promise of good results from this better way in regarding
such patients is more far reaching than on first thought might appear,
for the ex-opium habitué forced to stem a tide of distrust—special, as
to his cure, and general, as to the permanence of that cure—finds himself
hampered in continued well-doing by the lack of that hopeful trust
that would largely conduce to his good getting on.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a recent letter from a lady who honored the writer with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>care, nearly three years ago, she referred to the permanence of her
recovery, and added—“but as I found it difficult to make every one
believe this, much less acknowledge it in my favor, I resorted to the
best means I could think of to establish corroborative testimony that
<em>would</em> avail, and during <em>all</em> the time I have been in or near—the past
two years, I have gone regularly every few days to a physician of
prominence here, my old friend and medical adviser of many years’
standing, and had him make every test he desired, placing on record
my exact condition, and showing the real truth of the matter. I continue
to do this, and intend to do so, and have let people generally
know that such a record is being made. I need not tell you that I am
proud of my victory. The struggle against ungentle and unfair judgment
of those around you make a combination of overwhelming power
against the reformed opium taker. It is there that the <em>real</em> conflict
begins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The writer’s professional work among this class has long been along
the line here noted. He has extended confidence—very rarely has it
been broken; he has asked for confidence, and the general result can
be truly and tersely stated—increasing satisfaction and success.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now, gentlemen, what are the conclusions of this whole matter?
These.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reason and right alike demand a more rational and correct
idea as to the origin of the toxic neurosis we have noted.</p>

<p class='c009'>This demand complied with—regarding such patients, with certain
exceptions, as creatures of conditions beyond control, and so no more
culpable than the subjects of other functional disorder—will be most
helpful against the protective temptation to untruth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The medico-legal status of such cases will then be more in keeping
with advanced forensic medicine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The medical care of these cases will tend to a more humane
method, with a larger promise of good results, both near and remote.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will, too, be likely to lessen the increase of habitués, and the
number now existing, for a more correct idea as to the genesis of this
disorder will prompt medical men to greater care in avoiding the
cause, while many a patient—who now shrinks from disclosing his
misfortune—feeling he is not denied the charity his case deserves,
and that he can command resources both helpful and humane,
will be impelled to avail himself of the aid that scientific treatment
can surely extend.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>A CASE OF SPINA BIFIDA.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY JAMES W. INGALLS, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c003'>Presented to the Brooklyn Pathological Society, April 12, 1888.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On September 25th, 1888, was called to attend Mrs. H. in confinement.
Patient was a primipara about twenty years of age, and a
native of Mexico. Both she and her husband were free from any
deformity, and had always enjoyed excellent health. Duration of
pregnancy about nine months. Upon examination, I found the
breech presenting. Labor progressed favorably, and nothing occurred
worthy of special note, except that about half an hour before delivery,
while making a digital examination, I discovered over the sacrum of
the child a loose flap or fold of tissue, the nature of which at that time
I was unable to satisfactorily determine.</p>

<p class='c009'>After delivery I found the following condition: Over the lumbosacral
region were two flaps, each two inches and a half long and
about an inch wide; the outer borders were free, the middle portions
of the inner borders were attached over the spinal column, and at this
point of attachment there was an opening which communicated with
the spinal canal. This opening was about large enough to admit the
tip of the little finger. The anterior surface of the flaps was simply a
continuation of the integument, the posterior surface was a continuation
and expansion of the membranes of the spinal cord. The edges
of these folds were straight and showed no signs whatever of having
been torn or lacerated. There was atrophy and complete paralysis of
both lower limbs. No other deformities existed. Flaps were placed
in close apposition over the opening into the spinal canal, and upon
them was put a thick compress, held in place by a wide bandage.
The child continued to do well until the morning of the fourth day,
when convulsions developed, and death took place in a few hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dissection showed that there was a fissure of the spinal canal extending
from the second lumbar vertebra down to the sacrum, the
laminæ being absent. Both sciatic nerves were given off in the usual
manner.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The medical men of the Bay State have been treated several times
during the past decade to the mournful story of the meagre financial
results from a life-long practice of medicine in that commonwealth.
The detailed cases, narrated by Dr. Cotting, were pitiful enough, for
they were proof that a faithful, conscientious and skillful medical
career could find little laid aside for the “rainy day” of personal illness
or the vacation for the tired brain and body, or the reposeful life
of a physician’s family when death had closed in on his labors. In the
same strain Dr. Jeffries, in his late annual address before the Massachusetts
Medical Society, proclaims that “no man has made a fortune
as a physician, I mean no one ever paid his expenses and laid by at
interest enough to live on through the practice of medicine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This breathes in the atmosphere of complaint as if the profession
of medicine were exceptional in life’s vocations; as if it, alone of all
the lines of work, did not lead to financial results where “enough to
live on was laid by at interest.” It is very pertinent to ask, in what
pursuit in life inheres that tendency to make the laborers therein independent
of labor? It is equally pertinent to ask, where is there an
instance, in the history of labor, where a man, following the duty
common to his fellow workers and relying on his own unaided hands
and brain, ever acquired the competency to live, in his accustomed
sphere, independent of labor? Dr. Cotting’s instances of the poverty
of medical men are pitiful, but they are duplicated in the ranks of the
promoters of literature, art, science and philanthropic work through
historic time and will be multiplied to the end. Great wealth is the
possession of but very few and, on the lines of legitimate industry, is
always the result of combination and the use made of the labor of
others. In the early part of the century, Mr. Astor founded a fortune
by buying up pelts from the trappers of the Northwest. Had he
depended on what his own hands could have done, his old age would
have found him drying his skins and frying his bacon with his own
hands in his forest cabin. Mr. Carnegie to-day, utilizing the labor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>miners in iron and coal and giving direction to the skill and toil of a
multitude of mechanics, is still adding to his fifty millions. Had he
depended on the limitations of his own brawn, he might still each
evening be washing the grime from his horny hands under the faucet
in the hallway of his tenement house lodgings. These great possibilities
of combination are in the genius of commercial enterprise, though
they are realized by few. They are foreign to the genius of labor
where combination is impossible, and where the labor is of such a
character that there is no monopoly of skill and many can accomplish
it equally well. A medical man’s labor is limited by what he can himself
do, personally and unaided. He can neither delegate nor superintend.
His income is limited by these personal conditions, modified
only by the possession of some exceptional skill and the accidents of
popularity or environment. The engrossing character of his occupation
hinders him from the experience that justifies outside speculation
with acquired capital and restrains him from participation in outside
ventures which require freedom both of time and thought. He cannot
well add another string to his bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The results of combination in trade and the income from professional
labor are issues from distinct and opposite sources and have no
right to be compared or made the subject of invidious reflection. A
number of lawyers, each an expert in a special department, may form
a partnership, occupy a common office, each helping the other, the
emoluments going to the common fund. This is a sort of combine.
But the time is not yet ripe, and probably will never come, for the
incorporation of a great Medical Trust, with the names of a specialist
in eye, ear, throat, nose, lungs, liver, sphincter ani, corns and fallopian
tubes, and so on to the minutest subdivision, with the addition of
some general practitioners and apothecaries, displayed around the
casings of some common front door, to scoop in the community and
pool the receipts on a graded tariff. Trade is essentially selfish and
works for the individual. “If you don’t work for number one, number
two will be working for you.” The accumulation of money is
neither end nor contingent in professional life. The pursuit and application
of medical science are on the higher level with the learning of
jurists, scientists, educators and literateurs, whose mission is the unselfish
search for knowledge for the immediate benefit of mankind and
the advance of civilization.</p>

<p class='c009'>While it is true that very few in any calling “lay by at interest
enough to live on,” a very small number of that few do actually retire
from active work and live on that interest, and this for two reasons:
First, a man in successful professional life is in receipt of an income
which enables him to live in luxurious surroundings, gratify tastes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>enjoy recreation, which income, considered as interest, would represent
a capital sum exceptional even among the results of successful
trade, stock gambling or railroad wrecking. Such a man, and he is
one of many, could live on what he “has laid by at interest,” if he saw
fit to live in less luxury and sacrifice the gratification of tastes which
have been cultivated and become necessary to his comfort. He could
live on his interest, but he does not care to live in idleness. On the
other hand, the conditions of a cultured life are of an ever widening
horizon, and it is characteristic of medical men that their intellectual
sense is inquisitive, keen, appreciative and alert in their own sphere of
action, less satisfied with what is and more anxious for better results,
beyond the genius of any other professional life, and this for the distinctive
reason that every new discovery in medical science promotes
accuracy in the application of medical art. Working becomes a passion
with medical men; the more they know the more eager they are
to work. This passion is not to “lay by at interest enough to live on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is quite in the sentiment of medical addresses to bewail the profession
as ill-paid, and that, for a learned and self-sacrificing body of
men, its labor and accomplishments are very inadequately rewarded.
The exact contrary is, probably, very much nearer the truth. There
are many learned men in the profession and there is a wide range of
special learning which is the common property of the profession, and
all are more or less adept in the use of agencies of the art. There is,
likewise, a vast amount of patient and uncompensated care given in
the routine of practice, which is a natural outcome of the practice of
the medical art. It would be absurd to claim the diploma as representing
a liberal education or even high special attainments, as it
would be ridiculous to assert that a dispensary patient regularly received
the attention given to the German Kaiser or General Sheridan.
There are instances of failure and poverty among medical men, but
when the doctors in the country stand to the population in the proportion
of 1 to 580, the assumption is that they have become needful,
each to his 580. Doctors have many book charges that are not collected.
Laborers are swindled by their bosses, and every business man
meets his unlucky customers; the parish gets behind with its rector.
The doctor is no worse off than the rest, and besides he has no salary
list, and no accommodation at the bank to make good.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most men are discontented, and the want of contentment is just as
querulous with the cosmopolitan reputation that unblushingly pockets
a double eagle for a few raps on the thorax as with its suburban and
obscure double that explores a whole chest half an hour for a dollar.
The latter pays a shilling to the village blacksmith to reset a shoe, and
the former hands over eight dollars every time the farrier looks at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>team. Discontent goes with a misfit, and Depew told the Syracuse
students that “misfits were everywhere and were always cheap.” It is
doubtful if, upon the whole, there are in any walk in life such an
unbroken line of splendid fits, the man to his duty and his clientage,
as in the medical profession. It is not to be doubted that medical
men, each to his location, his culture, his taste and his instincts, are
better housed and clothed, more liberally supplied with the machinery
of their technique, have greater demands on their purse in the interests
of charity and reform which are duly met, have better educated families,
have longer and more frequent opportunities for enjoyment which
are not wasted, than can be counted item for item on the balance
sheet of the average worker in any other profession or occupation.
And these are the proofs of financial success, and they put aside the
plaint that because the doctors do not “lay by at interest enough to
live on” they are an ill-used class of men. The community pays liberally
for being taken care of, and it ought to. The medical man’s
entire time is taken up in acquiring the experience to exercise prompt
judgment in emergencies, and this is precisely what the community
pays for and is far from niggardly in the payment. Experience, needful
to prompt judgment, is worth more than day’s wages or marginal
profits, and this the community recognizes, and its estimate on the
value of this experience is generally just. It may not be invariably
accurate, but a doctor’s annual cash total is a very liberal estimate of
what his individual experience is worth to the community. If the
doctor does not “lay by at interest,” it is not because he does not
receive enough, but because his relations to life make a free expenditure
of money a necessity. He is at a certain disadvantage with a fair
share of the people in being compelled to pay his debts. An excellent
physician who is also a bohemian or with loose ideas as to honorable
obligation, would be a nondescript. He is a fixture in the community
with an open reputation, and it is proof of his liberal income
that he is able to make and sustain that reputation.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE OPEN STREET-CAR WHISTLE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The open street car is in its mid-career for 1888, and the fiend of
the whistler is on the vertex of successful practice. The stranglers of
the Orient were an occasional incident in that sunburnt civilization as
compared with the death-dealing, pestilential prevalence of the Brooklyn
open street-car conductor, literally “armed to the teeth” with his
offensive weapon, out of whose depths, impelled by æolic volumes from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>jerky and gigantic costo-diaphragmatic spasms, issue the ear-splitting
and nerve-rending combination of fog-horn and prolonged rifle-crack.
From stable to terminus and back, circulating along the outer step,
holding on to the uprights with extended arms, facing forever the five-cent
and helpless “fares,” two to four inches of potential reed or metal
protruding from his embracing lips, like an ill-placed proboscis on a
witless pachyderm, he summons the driver to screw up his brake and
arrest his sportive team for a fare to unload, or to reverse the process
for the temporary torture of more victims in hoisting in of other patrons
of the line, and the shrill horror of his whistling signal, right in the
faces of the passengers, is made more agonizing by the uncertainty of
when and on whom it will discharge its blast, being forever ready for
action, like the lance in rest of the jousting knight. It would be easy
to aim this calliope at the curbstone or the empyrean, but this regard
for the passengers’ tympanum disturbeth not the peaceful slumber of
the tramway directory, whose shibboleth is the Vanderbilt curse of
“the public be ——.” But sadder than the disregard of common-carriers
for public comfort is the unearthed conspiracy of the otologists
with the ill-paid conductors on the horse-cars. For some years this
specialty throve on the otitis acquired at the bathing-houses at Rockaway
and Coney Island, but the public discovered that a little cotton in
the meatus was the needful prophylactic, and otitis, as a source of
revenue, dwindled to the starvation point. Again, and for a time, the
horn of plenty overflows in the otologist’s operating room, and his
commissions to the car conductors promise to put them soon on a
plane with the diamond-bedecked shirt-fronts of the average hotel
clerk. It was said that so possessed was a certain London specialist
with the operation of tonsillotomy that these amputated glands were
each morning shoveled out of his office by the basketful. There are
compensations all through life, and the hordes of cash boys, whose
occupation vanished with the introduction of mechanical carriers into
the great dry good bazaars, now find ample and continuous employment
in sweeping out the heaped up fragments of shattered ear drums
from the infirmaries of otological specialists. Verily, this deal among
the ear men with the whistling open car conductors for the embezzlement
of the community deserves the most summary and high-handed
reprobation. There is but the faintest justification for such combination
in the new code, but even that cannot fairly be pleaded when the
integrity of the community’s ear is imperilled. A proper <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d’esprit</span>
would impel to the conservation of a professional brother’s prosperity,
but even that laudable sentiment must have subordinate place when
the profession at large, who are the conservators of society, see that
society is likely to turn a deaf ear to the varied forms of human plaint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and all owing to the men who can neither stop or start an open car of
a horse railroad without blowing out the ear drums of the community.
The public is in peril and who shall be the Curtius to jump into the
breach. The conductor cannot be appealed to. He is insensitive, and,
besides, he is in authority. One cannot knock the beastly clarion from
his lips’ embrace: there would be the claim for assault and ejection
for disorder. The directors are a weak reed; they dread a strike.
Municipal ordinance would be vainly sought: workingmen have a
union and votes. The police, even the finest, are not open to bribery:
they are at home in a brawl, and noise is their normal condition of
repose. The profession must interfere. Henceforth let the cry be
“boycott the whistle.” If it must exist, let the instruction be boldly
posted at the starter’s office: “Conductors must aim their whistles at
the curbstones and not in the ears of the passengers.”</p>

<h4 class='c012'>PROMPT TELEPHONE SERVICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The telephone is too useful not to be treated properly. It is always
an affair of two parties and each is in duty bound to be considerate of
the other. The bell rings, it is answered promptly, and patience
becomes well nigh exhausted before “central” succeeds in establishing
the connection, and the time of the respondent is wasted. The reason
for this rests on the thoughtlessness or selfishness of the one who makes
the call. He rings and asks for a certain connection, and then hangs
up his instrument, goes away to wait for a summons. In the meantime
the respondent answers, stays by his instrument, “central” endeavors
to call up the caller, perhaps through another office, the
connection is often broken, and after much tribulation the connection
is fully made. This is of very frequent occurrence and could be
avoided, for the most part, by the caller staying by his instrument for
the few seconds usually required to make the connection. There are
occasional instances of bad management and some ugliness in the
central office, but they are quite rare, and the service is very prompt.
More delay and annoyance are caused by thoughtlessness of the users
of the telephone than by any neglect of duty on the part of the operators
at the central offices. One who is called up has a right to consider
that he is wanted, and that promptly. It is the duty of the caller to
be careful not to annoy the central office or waste the respondent’s
time. Moral: When you call, stay by your instrument till the reply
comes.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>OFFICIAL ORTHOEPY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Mayor has made his appointments to the vacancies in the
Board of Education. The proper assumption is that they are all
good men and true, able to read, write and cipher. It would be
worse than libelous to give houseroom to the rumor that any member
of this responsible Board ever “made his mark.” One would be
properly horrified at the audacity of the narrator of such a tale as the
following: A member of a local committee entered the class-room as
the teacher was conducting the recitation in spelling from the Reader.
After listening for awhile, he intimated his desire “to give out a few
words,” which desire was politely acceded to, and the book handed to
him. A number of words were correctly and promptly spelled, and
he gave out the word “Egg-pit.” One child after another was downed
by the astute member until the teacher, in pity for her flock, suggested
that the word was not in the lesson. Smiling disdainfully at her ignorance
and presumption, he pointed his No. 11 forefinger to E-g-y-p-t.
Tableau. The Directory for 1888 intimates that we live in a city of
nearly 800,000 inhabitants.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><em>PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.</em></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c008'>THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE COUNTY OF KINGS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A regular monthly meeting of the Medical Society of the County of
Kings was held at the rooms of the Society, No. 356 Bridge Street,
Brooklyn, on June 19, 1888.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meeting was called to order at 8.30 P. M., with Dr. Wallace
in the chair.  There were eighty members present.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minutes of the previous meeting were read, and on motion
adopted as read.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Council reported favorably on the names of the following
gentlemen: Drs. Sidney Allen Fox, George H. Treadwell, Fred. L.
Goddard, Stanton Allen, Horace B. Scott.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following gentlemen were declared elected members of the
Society: Drs. Chas. S. Fischer, James L. Carney, Eliot Gorton, Heber
N. Hooper, Henry H. Morton, Geo. B. Rockwell, Lewis S. Meeker.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following gentlemen were proposed for membership:</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. J. Le Roy Tettemore, 128 Rockaway Avenue; graduated at
L. I. C. H., 1881, proposed by Dr. J. H. Hunt and seconded by Dr.
W. B. Chase.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Stanton Allen, 114 Montague Street, graduated at College of
Physicians and Surgeons, 1881, proposed by Dr. Richmond Lennox
and seconded by Dr. J. S. Prout.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. James W. E. Roby, 115 Lee Avenue, graduated at Medical
Department, N. Y. University, 1887, proposed by Dr. D. Myerle, seconded
by Dr. W. M. Hutchinson.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Charles G. Purdy, 56 Pulaski Street, graduated at the University
of the City of New York, proposed by Dr. Chase and seconded
by Dr. Little.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Secretary stated that the name of Dr. Stanton Allen was among
the propositions for membership presented at this meeting, and also
among those reported favorably by the Council.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said in explanation that Dr. Allen’s diploma had been sent to
the Board of Censors and passed upon before his name had been proposed,
in order that the diploma might not remain with the Censors
till next September.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was an infringement of the By-Laws upon admission of members,
but if no objection was raised, the By-Laws would be waived in
this case.</p>

<p class='c009'>No objection was offered.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>SCIENTIFIC BUSINESS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The first paper of the evening, “On the Relation of the Bacillus
Tuberculosis in Pulmonary Phthisis,” was read by Dr. I. H. Platt, of
Lakewood, N. J., and discussed by Drs. G. R. Butler, J. M. Van Cott,
J. H. H. Burge, P. H. Kretzschmar and G. A. Evans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next paper was “A Case of Dystocia and Double Phlegmasia-dolens,”
by Dr. Lucy M. Hall. This was discussed by Drs. Dickinson,
Thayer, Skene, Chase, Schenck and Harrigan.</p>

<p class='c009'>A paper, entitled “Note on the Disinfection of Physicians’ Clothing,”
by Dr. R. L. Dickinson, was then read and discussed.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The President called for the report of the Obituary Committees upon
the late Drs. Chapman and Mitchell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The obituary report of the late Dr. Chauncey L. Mitchell was then
read by Dr. Burge, as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Chauncey L. Mitchell, whose ancestors were of Puritan stock, coming
to this country from Halifax, England, as early as 1635, was born
in New Canaan, Connecticut, November 20, 1813. An excellent general
education, obtained here and at Union College, Schenectady, was
supplemented by a full course of study in the medical department of
the University of the State of New York, better known as the College
of Physicians and Surgeons, where he was graduated in 1836. The
next twelve months were spent in the New York Hospital, and the
succeeding two years on the continent of Europe. All who knew Dr.
Mitchell intimately are so familiar with his studious habits that they
need not be told that he never lost an opportunity for observation and
improvement. This was true of him, not only during the period of
his pupilage, but in all the fifty years of his active practice, five of
which were in the City of New York. He came to Brooklyn in 1844,
was admitted to membership in the Society of the County of Kings soon
after, and was thrice honored by an election to its highest office. All
the duties of his active life he performed with dignity and zeal. No
one more than he enjoyed the uninterrupted confidence and affection
of this community. Among his friends and patients were numbered
the best of our citizens, and he is now equally missed in the profession,
in the church and in the household. Dr. Mitchell was an earnest and
devout believer in the Christian religion. His connection with the
Church of the Pilgrims antedates the pastorate of the Rev. Dr. Storres,
between whom and himself there was an intimate, personal and professional
relationship for forty years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Mitchell’s powers of observation and discrimination and his
exactness of verbal expression were so excellent, that we regret that he
did not give more time to authorship. An article on “The Effects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Ergot,” “Labor Complicated with Disease of the Heart,” and an occasional
contribution to the journals, are all that we can find of his
writings.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the period of declining health, which occupied more than
two years, Dr. Mitchell resigned many positions of responsibility, yet,
at the time of his death, he was Sn. member of the Council of the
Long Island College Hospital, member of the Amer. Med. Asso., Consulting
Surgeon to St. John’s Hospital, to L. I. Coll. Hospital and to
the Home for Aged Men, a member of the New York Academy of
Medicine, New York Co. Med. Soc., and Kings Co. Med. Asso. He
was also a life member and Corres. Sec’t’y of the L. I. Historical
Society. It is matter of record that he was once a member of the
Medical Staff of the Brooklyn City Hospital, and that he also filled
with honor the Professorship of Obstetrics in the Castleton Medical
College.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1843, Dr. Mitchell married <em>Caroline</em>, daughter of Hon. B. F.
Langdon; in 1857, <em>Frances</em>, daughter of Hon. Benjamin Wright; in
1875, <em>Kate</em>, daughter of Hon. J. M. Van Cott, of this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Mitchell’s tastes were professional, literary, artistic and religious,
but the centre of all was his own home. In the house which he had
built more than forty years before, he died on the 8th of May, 1888,
terminating a long career of untiring usefulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Chairman: In the preparation of this minute for the records
of the Society, your committee have recognized the fact that they were
appointed for this simple duty only. The pronouncing of a suitable
eulogy belongs to other hands and to another occasion. We offer for
your consideration the following:</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, In obedience to the Divine Law the fully matured life of
Chauncey L. Mitchell is ended on earth, and</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, He was destined to fill a high position in the profession
of medicine and as a citizen of this country, and</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, He met all these requirements, fulfilled every duty, and
discharged every obligation in such manner as only a highly cultivated,
educated and honest man could, and</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, When the end came, those who knew him best could
truly say  that he had left nothing undone to complete a noble, highly
useful and honorable life;</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Therefore be it resolved</em>, That while paying this tribute to his memory
we desire to express our high appreciation of his many virtues, and
that while we deeply feel our loss, we also cherish his memory, and are
grateful for the honor, dignity and advancement which his life’s work
gave to this Society.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Resolved</em>, That we offer our deepest sympathy to his bereaved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>family, and that a copy of these resolutions be conveyed to them as a
humble tribute to his superior worth.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of which is respectfully submitted by your committee.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE GERM THEORY A CENTURY AGO.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Under this caption the British Med. Journal for February 11, 1888,
contains an editorial review of a pamphlet of 87 pages, published in
1788, and entitled: “<cite>A Treatise on Fevers, wherein their Causes are
exhibited in a new point of view, to prevent Contagion; and Putrid Sore
Throat, Inflammatory Fluxes, Influenza, Consumptions, as well as the Low
Nervous Fevers that terribly affect the Spirits, may be cured with ease</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The most remarkable part of the book is the speculative or explanatory
part, consisting of an exceedingly ingenious argument, based
upon the analogy of admitted facts, to prove that the cause of contagious
fevers is some invisible noxious matter in the air. Of the intimate
nature of this matter he says: Some consider it to be a sulphurous
exhalation from the earth; but this cannot be, for, if so, acrid and
sulphurous fumes would increase it, instead of checking or annihilating
it. Another theory is that it is due to the products of putrefaction;
but how can dead putrid matter ever get such activity as to work such
astonishing results? It must therefore be something endowed with a
more powerful activity than anything belonging to the mineral kingdom
or simply putrefying matter, and must, therefore, be something
“actually living.” He further concludes that these living organisms
must have an existence independent of the body in which they are
found. For this view, surprising and novel enough at first, loses some
of its singularity, if we search for resemblances elsewhere. Now, just
as it was well known that itch is due to the presence of acari, insects
visible by the aid of the microscope, so close attention to these matters
in numberless cases during many years, has proved beyond a doubt
that the gaol distemper, putrid fever, plague, and infectious epidemics
generally, proceed not from matter putrid in itself, but from invisible
insects also, that, floating in the air at times, are lodged in the skin in
immense quantities; feeding here in clusters, they produce pimples,
pustules, etc.; for instance, the eruption of small-pox. He overlooks,
or fails to mention, the possibility of their entering by the air passages
or digestive system. “Medicines,” he says, “which poison insects
without injuring the constitution have always proved specific.” These
insects, which constitute contagion, are communicated by air, the raiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>as by contact. He admits that vegetables as well as animals
suffer from the ravages of these animalcules. He believed that they
originated from eggs and not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</span></i>. He advises fumigations with
sulphur and frankincense to destroy contagion in rooms, and shows
that many diseases in lower animals are cured or prevented by the use
of certain agents known to kill insects.</p>

<p class='c009'>In summing up his theory, he says that, generally speaking, there
are two sources of these animalcules. First, from subterranean sources,
which operate in all sorts of weather and are accompanied by electrical
phenomena. Second, from the surface of the earth, swamps, filthy
lakes, stagnant ponds, etc. The eggs left on the soil develop in summer,
and “the multitudes effluviate into air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The essay is interesting to us because of the very clear foreshowing
of a theory that we are apt to regard as the creation of recent years.
It is a good example of the power of attentive observation and inductive
reasoning, which is so seldom met with even in scientific medical
men of the present day.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>ALBUMINURIA A FREQUENT RESULT OF SEWAGE POISONING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dr. George Johnson, in <cite>Br. Med. Jour.</cite> for March 3d, gives the
histories of four cases of albuminuria which he believes were the result
of breathing sewer air. In addition to other diseases, the result of
drain poison, the author has met with several cases of albuminuria
which he believes can and does under continued exposure to the sewer
poison, result in incurable disorganization of the kidneys. He thinks
that, in the absence of other probable exciting causes of albuminuria,
the possibility of sewer poisoning should be constantly borne in mind.
It is needless to dilate upon the importance of discovering the exciting
cause of a disease so serious in its consequences as nephritis. In each
of the four cases cited, albuminuria and casts were found in the urine,
and blood in two of them. In each case defective drainage was proven,
and in two of the four an immediate improvement occurred on removing
this cause. One proved fatal from suppression of the urine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The author suggests as an interesting point, that amongst the various
diseases resulting from drain poison, diphtheria is in a very large
proportion of cases associated with albuminuria.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be interesting to know whether a large proportion of cases
of diphtheria occurring in houses having defective plumbing suffer with
albuminuria, than in houses where no such defect exists. If these
observations are confirmed, we may learn from them something of the
cause of the great fatality of scarlet fever and diphtheria in houses
which contain defective drains.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>SEWER-AIR POISONING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The question of sewer-air poisoning has received no inconsiderable
attention at the hands of sanitarians within the past few years, some
claiming that it is a carrier of many of the contagious diseases, including
malarial affections, while others have denied its harmful action in
these respects.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last class, in substantiation of their claim, point to the assumed
fact that plumbers and those who work in sewers are not, as a rule,
especially subject to the diseases generally attributed to sewer air. That
plumbers are not exempt from troubles of this kind is attested by
numerous examples. According to <cite>Science</cite>, an inquest was recently
held in Liverpool, Eng., on the body of a plumber’s apprentice who
had been engaged in repairing pipes which connected with the sewer.
Quantities of gas came through these pipes, and at the time the young
man complained of pain and sickness, and died forty hours afterward.
The jury rendered a verdict of poisoning by sewer air.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the <cite>Sanitary News</cite>, Dr. Vaughn, of the Michigan
State Laboratory of Hygiene, claims to have found the specific germ
of typhoid fever in the air of a soil pipe from the prison at Jackson, in
that State, during an outbreak of typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Sanitary Inspector</cite> for February and March, reproduces from
the <cite>Medical News</cite> an article by Dr. Henry Hun upon this subject. Dr.
Hun cites twenty-nine cases in support of his statements. The histories
are those of non-contagious diseases, and therefore were probably
cases of illness produced by non-infected sewers. He says: “In
all of these twenty-nine cases there was an escape of a large amount of
sewer gas into the air which the patients breathed; and at the time that
the case was observed, it seemed extremely probable that the sewer gas
was the cause of the disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From the consideration of these twenty-nine cases, we may conclude
that it is probable that the following conditions may result from
sewer-air poisoning:</p>

<p class='c009'>“1. Vomiting and purging, either separately or combined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“2. A form of nephritis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“3. General debility, in some cases of which the heart is especially
involved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“4. Fever, which is frequently accompanied by chills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“5. Sore throat, which is frequently of a diphtheritic character.</p>

<p class='c009'>“6. Neuralgia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These conditions may occur separately, but are frequently combined,
and it is especially common for the fever to be associated with
other symptoms of sewer-gas poisoning. Finally, in cases of sewer-gas
poisoning, there is one group of symptoms which is almost always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>prominent, and these symptoms are: loss of appetite, drowsiness, extreme
prostration, and a dull, unpleasant feeling in the head; and
whenever this group of symptoms occurs, not as the result of an attack
of acute disease, but as a chronic condition, we are justified in suspecting
that the patient is exposed to sewer-gas infection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Experiments with varying amounts of diastase showed that one
part of salicylic acid to 1,000 of liquid prevented the diastasic action
completely. Saccharine in the proportion of 1 to 1,000 prevented the
formation of sugar when the proportion of diastase was 1 to 1,000 of
liquid. When the proportion of diastase was reduced to 1 in 2,000,
salicylic in the proportion of 1 to 3,000 prevented the formation of
sugar. It seems, then, that the weaker the diastasic solution, the more
is its action hindered by salicylic acid, saccharine, etc. Sodium bisulphite
has little if any power of hindering diastasic power.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tests were made with 0.2 grams of the extract.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems from these experiments that salicylic acid and saccharine,
in the proportions used, entirely prevent the action of pancreatic ferment
upon starch.</p>

<p class='c009'>In similar experiments with saccharated pepsine with hydrochloric
acid, except that the temperature was kept at 105° F., sodium bisulphite
and boric acid were without effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Saccharine and salicylic acid had a slightly retarding action. Beta-naphthol
almost entirely prevented the action.</p>

<p class='c009'>With pancreatic digestion of albumen the results were practically
the same, but the retarding action of the salicylic acid and
saccharine was not quite so well marked.</p>

<p class='c009'>From these experiments it will be seen that salicylic acid prevents
the conversion of starch into sugar under the influence of either diastase
or pancreatic extract, but does not seriously interfere with peptic
or pancreatic digestion of albumen. Saccharine holds about the same
relation as salicylic acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sodium bisulphite and boric acid are practically without retarding
effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beta-naphthol decidedly interferes with the formation of sugar by
diastase, but not with the action of pancreatic extract on starch.</p>

<p class='c009'>It almost entirely prevents both peptic and pancreatic digestion of
albumen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bearing of these experiments upon the sanitary question of
permitting the use of these preservatives in foods, is self-evident. Prof.
Leffman says: “Their use is scarcely allowable under any circumstances,
and certainly only when the nature of the preservative and the
amount is distinctly stated.” The use of saccharine as a sweetening
agent must be looked upon as deleterious to health, and ought to be
forbidden by sanitary authorities.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>MILK AND SCARLATINA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>In a recent number of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span>, we published an abstract of the
reported investigations of Mr. Power, Dr. Cameron and Dr. Klein of
a disease among cows, which they believed had caused scarlatina
among persons using the milk. The conclusions reached by these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>gentlemen seemed so startling that the Agricultural Department of the
Privy Council began an investigation of the disease. The investigation
was given into the hands of Dr. Cruikshank, whose reports are published
in the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite> of December 17, 1887, and January
21, 1888.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have only space here to reproduce the conclusions reached by
Dr. Cruikshank, which are as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. The nature of the contagium of scarlet fever is unknown.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The micro-organism regarded by Dr. Klein as this contagium is
the <em>streptococcus pyogenes</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is found sometimes in company with
<em>staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em>, as a secondary result in scarlet fever and
many other diseases.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. A streptococcus was first observed in scarlet fever by Crooke,
later by Löffler, Huebner and Bahrdt; but its exact relation to scarlatina,
and its undoubted identity with the streptococcus from pus and
puerperal fever, was definitely established in 1885 by Frankel and
Freudenberg.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Both the Wiltshire and Hendon cow diseases were called cow-pox
by the people on the farms.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Both diseases correspond in their clinical history.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The ulcers on the teats correspond in naked eye and microscopical
appearances, and the latter vividly recall the appearances of
cow-pox.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Calves inoculated from the discharges of the ulcers are similarly
affected.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. <em>Post-mortem</em> examination of such calves, or of calves inoculated
with streptococci isolated from scarlet fever cases, show similar appearances.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The <em>post-mortem</em> appearances in such inoculated calves are the
result of septicæmia.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. There are no specific visceral changes in cow-pox, apart from
complications or coincident affections.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the above criticism of Dr. Klein’s investigation of the Hendon
cow disease, this gentleman claims that Dr. Cruikshank studied a different
affection, and that the organisms were not the same. It is insisted
upon by Dr. Klein, that Dr. Cruikshank’s conclusions were the result
of studying cow-pox and not the peculiar disease he described as the
Hendon cow disease.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN PHTHISIS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dr. R. W. Philip has made an experimental study to determine the
cause of death in phthisis. The results of his study are published in
the <cite>Brit. Med. Jour.</cite> of Jan. 28th, 1888.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>His experiments were conducted with an extract prepared from
fresh sputum from phthisical patients, as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>The sputum was treated with alcohol, put in a sterilizer, and heated
to 37 to 40° C. for some time, filtered clear, and evaporated at a low
temperature until the alcohol was expelled. This extract was used for
subcutaneous injections in frogs, mice, and rabbits.</p>

<p class='c009'>This extract was found to possess very marked toxic properties upon
these animals, which manifested themselves by a depression of the
higher nerve centres and of the heart. The depressant action upon the
heart seemed to be exerted through the cardio-inhibitory mechanism,
and is more or less completely antagonized by atropine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The toxic principle he believes to be the result of the growth of the
tubercular bacilli, and allied to the ptomaines. He found the quantity
of the substance to be extracted from the sputum to be proportional
to the abundance of the bacilli present in it. These observations
are in accordance with the observations of various experimenters with
other pathogenic organisms, and with the theory that seems to be gaining
ground that immunity is the result of such by-products of the
growth of these organisms.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF MYXŒDEMA FOLLOWING TOTAL OR PARTIAL EXTIRPATION OF THE THYROID BODY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>J. L. Reverdin (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Congrès Francais de Chirurgie, 2 session, Paris,
1886.</span>) This disease, following frequently in the after-history
of cases of extirpation of the thyroid body, and called by Kocher,
of Berne, cachexia stumpriva, was first described by Reverdin,
and by him called “operative myxœdema.” His description of
this disease coincides in general with the views now generally held,
although we find some not unimportant deviations from Kocher’s conclusions;
for instance, the latter observed the disease twenty-four
times following thirty-four operations, it appearing to attack by preference
those who had not attained their full development. On the other
hand, R., basing his experience upon copious statistics, believes the
disease is comparatively rare, following upon operations of the thyroid
in only twenty-seven per cent. of cases. In his experience, it likewise
preferably attacks children and young persons, but that it occasionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>fails to occur after complete thyrotomy. Further, R. has observed a
milder form of the disease, differing essentially from the graver type of
the affection, which latter invariably tends progressively to a fatal termination.
In the milder form, the disease is described as oscillating
between relapses and improvement, lasting for years, cure sometimes
resulting. Several cases are detailed supporting these observations. In
two of these, it was supposed that the thyroid had been extirpated in
toto, but it was subsequently discovered that a small portion of the
gland had remained. Three cases are worthy of especial note. In
these, after partial extirpation, in one the right lobe, and in two the
left having been removed, an imperfect form of the disease made its
appearance after several months. The characteristic signs, such as
swelling of the face and limbs and hesitancy of speech and of muscular
movements were absent; while the other symptoms, such as general
weakness, pains in the limbs, chest, and head, greater or less loss of
memory, chilly sensations, reminded one distinctly of the more complete
form of the disease. In all these cases slow improvement followed.
Another case is worthy of notice from the fact that, two
months after the operation, the remaining lobe had so atrophied as to
be scarcely distinguishable. Cases of this atrophy following partial
extirpation have been observed both in Germany and in England.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>UPON LUXATION OF THE HEAD OF THE RADIUS FORWARD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Raestock (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Militärärztl. Zeitschrift, 1887, p. 331</span>) has, by
means of experiments upon the cadaver, shown that this accident occurs
in forced pronation while the radius is resting upon the ulna at the point
where the former crosses the latter, the ulna acting as a fulcrum. The
head of the radius is pressed against its capsule and tears the latter.
More rarely, the accident may occur in forced supination, by pressing
the bone against the posterior edge of the ulna, the head of the radius
being luxated through a rent made by a rupture of the external lateral
ligament between the outer and inner sides; upon pronating the hand,
this outward dislocation is converted into a forward one. The annular
ligament is either torn or else the coronoid process of the ulna is
broken. In either case the interposition of the annular ligament in the
fold of the joint becomes an obstacle to reduction. In the experiments
as detailed, great force was necessary in the production of the
luxation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should active and passive movements, manipulation, etc., fail to
remove the obstacles to reduction, the author advises a resort to secondary
resection of the displaced head of the radius; this, with proper
precautions, is certainly a most wise and rational procedure.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>CHOLECYSTOTOMY, WITH LIGATURE OF THE CYSTIC DUCT.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Zielewicz (Centralblatt f. Chirurgie, No. 13, 1888,) proposes in addition
to the so-called “ideal” method of Spencer Wells, that of suturing
the gall bladder to the abdominal wound, to ligate the cystic duct,
in order to insure the patient against the return of the biliary lithiasis.
The only case in which he has tried it was one in which an attempt was
being made to perform cholecystectomy, but the adhesions between the
gall bladder and liver were so dense and unyielding as to render the removal
impossible, on account of severe hæmorrhage. He therefore
passed two ligatures around the cystic duct and divided the latter
between them. The gall bladder was then fastened to the abdominal
wound, incised and emptied of its contained calculus and biliary
secretion. The patient made a good recovery, a fistula remaining, of
which the writer says, that “after a time it was almost closed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The author claims for this operation the following advantages:
1st. Rapid healing without a resulting fistula. The gall bladder is
practically removed from the organism. With appropriate after treatment,
its secretion soon ceases, and it becomes obliterated. 2d. The
operation is simple and less dangerous than cholecystectomy, and
gives the same results.</p>

<p class='c009'>In contrasting this operation with cholecystotomy, it may be said
that the latter simply aims at removing the existing calculi, and makes
no provision against the recurrence of the same. Where the “natural”
method of Bernay is adopted, and the gall bladder dropped back
into the abdominal cavity after suturing the incision made in its walls
for the removal of its contents, in case of a recurrence of the disease,
the entire operation must be repeated. In the “ideal” method of
Spencer Wells, only an incision need be made, in such an emergency,
at the site of the first operation. Troublesome fistulæ, however, are
apt to remain.</p>

<p class='c009'>In cholecystectomy, on the other hand, hæmorrhage from breaking
down of adhesions between the gall bladder and the surface of the
liver, it is claimed, is a frequent and troublesome complication. It is
claimed by Thiriar, however (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“De l’intervention chirurgicale dans certains
cas de lithiase biliaire,” <cite>Revue de chirurgie, 1886, No. 3</cite></span>), that
cholecystectomy is a less dangerous operation than simple cholecystotomy.
Again, by Bardenheuer, that hæmorrhage from the liver can be
readily arrested. The abstractor witnessed an operation in which the
liver was accidentally wounded and the resulting hæmorrhage arrested
by the thermo-cautery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hertin, a French naval surgeon, in 1767, after experiments made
upon dogs, proposed, in wounds of the gall bladder, extirpation of the
latter, after ligature of the cystic duct.  In these experiments he demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the feasibility of the operation of cholecystectomy upon the
lower animals, at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>Campaignac, in 1826, proposed ligature of the cystic duct, with
partial resection of the gall bladder (Journ. hebdom. Bd. ii, 1829).
K. Zagorski has recently attempted this latter procedure on dogs, with
fatal results (<span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl">Przegl. lekarski, 1887, No. 48</span>). Nevertheless, to Zielewicz
belongs the credit of being the first to demonstrate, by its successful
performance, the feasibility of combining in man the two operations
of ligature of the cystic duct and cholecystotomy with suture of the
gall bladder to the abdominal wound. Upon further trial the operation
may prove to be not only feasible, but to follow out a rational
indication with relative safety.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>SUPRA-PUBIC PROSTATECTOMY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>A. F. McGill, F.R.C.S.  (<cite>The Lancet</cite>, February 4, 1888). The
operation consists of two parts: (1) The opening and drainage
of the bladder; and (2) The removal of the prostatic valve which
prevents the egress of the urine. A full sized silver catheter,
curved according to the nature of the case, is passed into the
bladder, its contained urine withdrawn and its cavity washed out
with a warm saturated solution of boracic acid till this is returned
clean and unchanged. The usual rubber rectal bag is now introduced
and filled with fourteen ounces of water. The bladder is now rendered
prominent by injecting it with a sufficient amount of warm boracic
acid solution. The catheter is retained in the bladder, and the fluid
with which the latter has been distended, prevented from escaping.
The usual median supra-pubic incision is now made, the bladder exposed
and made to project into the abdominal wound by depressing
the catheter. A large curved tenaculum is now passed transversely
into the bladder, touching as it goes the point of the catheter. An
incision is now made longitudinally through the bladder wall, the fluid
being prevented from escaping by plugging the opening with the
finger. The bladder is now seized with nibbed forceps, and applied
on each side of the incision, the catheter is withdrawn from the urethra
and the bag from the rectum, and the first part of the operation is
complete. The interior of the bladder and its neck is now examined,
in order to ascertain the exact nature of the prostate enlargement. A
pedunculated middle lobe can be removed with the curved scissors, but
in the case of a sessile middle lobe, this must be assisted with the
finger and forceps. The “collar” enlargement is removed with greater
difficulty. In order to insure the patency of the urethra, it is advised
to pass the forefinger into the canal as far as the first joint. It is
claimed that the hæmorrhage is not excessive. The operation completed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>drainage is effected by passing a rubber tube out of the abdominal
wound, the latter being partially closed by a point or two of
suture. The tube is removed after forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The author’s experience is limited to five cases, four of which have
proved successful, while the fifth case is still under treatment. He
claims that, in cases operated upon early, before diseased bladder or
surgical kidney have developed, a radical cure may confidently be
expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two objections to this method occur to us: (1) Whoever has performed
or witnessed supra-pubic cystotomy, either for the purposes of
removal of a calculus or a neoplasm from the interior of the bladder,
must have been struck by the difficulties in the way of a thorough appreciation
of the condition of its posterior wall low down, or of the
cystic neck. Unless specially devised instruments are available for each
particular form of prostatic enlargement, it would seem to be a matter
of great uncertainty as to just how much of the growth is removed.
(2) Until satisfactory granulation of the wound surfaces has been accomplished,
drainage, to be efficient, must be facilitated by placing
the patient upon one or the other side, a position difficult to maintain,
particularly in old people.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>RESEARCHES UPON THE VAGINAL PROCESS OF THE PERITONEUM AS A PREDISPOSING CAUSE OF TENDENCY TO EXTERNAL INGUINAL HERNIA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>H. Sachs (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv. f. Klinisch. Chirurgie, Band xxxv., p. 321–372</span>)
advocates quite decidedly the view, basing his opinions upon preparations
of the spermatic cord examined and upon microscopic examinations
of cross sections of the latter, particularly as to the relations of the
vas deferens and the vessels to the vaginal process of the peritoneum,
that the latter is formed before the beginning of the descent of the testicle
rather than as a portion of the abdominal wall formed or dragged into
position by the testicle in its descent. In proof, he alleges that he has
always found, in cases of incomplete descent of the testicle, that organ
upon the posterior wall of the vaginal process, and not on the floor
of the same. In females, the formation of the canal of Nuck cannot
be said to be due to any dragging.</p>

<p class='c009'>The entrance to the opening of the vaginal process is found covered
by a valve arrangement, and the same is particularly noticeable in the
canal of Nuck. The opening of the vaginal process can be caused to
gape through a spreading out of the mesentery attached to the ilium or
that of the sigmoid flexure. The diameter of the opening is, in general,
greater on the right side than on the left in boys, while in girls
this difference is not observed. Further, the different forms of the
incompletely obliterated opening of the vaginal process agrees with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>most frequently occurring forms of the hernial sac in inguinal hernia.
The relations of the vaginal process to the elementary parts of the
spermatic cord are not constant. On the contrary, the relations which
the smooth muscular structures of the cord bear to the vaginal process,
in so far as their arrangement into bundles, and their positive relation
to the posterior and lateral walls of the same are concerned, are quite
constant, and almost form an integral part of the same. The obliteration
of the vaginal process depends upon a granulating process, which
begins in the middle third of the funnicular portion, and from thence
proceeds more rapidly in a downward than in an upward direction.
This granulation formation takes place essentially during the first ten
to twenty days after birth; after this time it takes place more slowly.
The canal of Nuck, on the contrary, is found to have almost entirely
disappeared at the time of birth. They are both found to be more frequently
open upon the right side.</p>

<p class='c009'>From these observations it would appear that it is not essential to
the production of inguinal hernia that a broad and short inguinal
canal should be present. The only essential predisposing cause, in
children at least, depends upon the condition of the vaginal process of
the peritoneum itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question of the legal responsibility of employers is an interesting
one, in connection with this question. Hernia cannot be considered
as an accident, in the surgical sense, according to Socin
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Korrespondenzblatt f. Schweizer Aertze, 1887, No. 18</span>), but is really a
slowly occurring disease, to which certain well-defined anatomical
peculiarities act as predisposing causes.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>ACID SUBLIMATE SOLUTION IN SURGERY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>E. Laplace (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Med. Wochenschrift, No. 40, 1887</span>), after
repeated and careful examinations and experiments, became convinced
that dressing materials consisting of wood-wool, made with sublimate
in the usual manner, were far from being germless themselves, much
less efficient as antiseptic applications. Gauze, however, showed much
better results, but were far from realizing an idealistic asepsis. He
likewise found that ordinary sublimate, in the presence of albuminous
material, is quickly precipitated and becomes at once ineffective. L.
experimented at first with hydrochloric acid as a means of preventing
changes in the sublimate from occurring in the presence of organic
matter, and particularly albuminous material. But, as hydrochloric
acid itself was far from possessing the stability needful for the purpose
of preparing dressings, he substituted for it, with the most gratifying
results, tartaric acid. The proportions are as follows: sublimate,
1 part; tartaric acid, 5 parts; distilled water, 1,000 parts.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF PYOTHORAX.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>E. Rochelt (Wiener med. Presse, No. 32 and 38, 1887). The expansion
of the lung is greatly impeded after the usual operation for
empyema by incision, by the free entrance of air in the pleural cavity.
Mader, Subbolik and Immerman devised means for preventing this. R.
operates by first resecting a rib, leaving the periosteum intact, and subsequently
opening the pleural cavity by means of a trocar and canula.
A drainage tube accurately filling the latter is now introduced, through
which a disinfecting fluid is injected and its outer opening closed by
means of a spring clamp. The tube is connected to an aspirating
bottle, into which the pus is discharged. The tube is again clamped,
and the bottle into which the pus has been aspirated removed, being
replaced by another containing a sublimate solution, 1 to 500. Removal
of the clamp and raising and lowering the bottle thoroughly
irrigates the pleural cavity. This being accomplished, the patient
holding his breath in expiration, and the clamp again applied, the
irrigating bottle is removed, and a short hard rubber tube connected to
the outer end of the drainage tube. This hard rubber tube has a
soft rubber diaphragm which acts as a check valve, effectually preventing
the ingress of air during inspiration, but in no wise interfering
with the egress of fluid from the pleural cavity during expiration, fits
of coughing, etc. For purposes of further irrigation the short rubber
tube containing the valve may be removed after guarding against the
entrance of air by clamping the drainage tube beyond, and the washing
bottle reapplied. During the intervals of irrigation, absorbent
antiseptic dressing are kept applied.</p>

<p class='c009'>The abstractor would suggest the application of this method, particularly
in recent cases and in children, without the previous resection
of a rib. The increased support afforded the canula by the greater
thickness of the thoracic walls would be a still greater safeguard against
the entrance of air into the pleural cavity. A certain proportion of
acute cases will recover without resection of a rib.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>WOUND-HEALING UNDER THE DRY ASEPTIC SCAB.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prof. Kuester (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Centralblatt f. Chirurgue</span>, March 17, 1888,) in reply
to remarks made by Dr. Sonnenberg before the Association of Berlin
Surgeons, January 9, who characterized K’s method of treating the
wound after the operation for the radical cure of hernia as an “open
method,” objects to this designation of his method, and takes occasion
to more fully describe his method as follows: After the reduction of
the contents of the sac, the latter is sutured and excised, and the ring
is also closed by suturing. The wound cavity itself is now closed by
several rows of buried sutures, so arranged as to bring together the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>edges of the several layers, tissue to like tissue. In congenital cases
he does not loosen the sac, but sutures its opposing surfaces down
to the point where the testicle lies free. The wound of the skin is
now closed by a continuous silk suture, and an iodoform and collodion
mixture brushed over the line of suturing until it is perfectly covered
in and blood no longer oozes through. No drain is used, and no further
dressing is deemed necessary. If, after two or three days, a split
occurs in the scab or crust formed by the drying of the iodoform and
collodion, the gap is quickly filled by a slight oozing from the deeper
portions of the wound, which, upon drying, becomes a bar against
infection.</p>

<p class='c009'>There can be no doubt, if thorough asepsis is observed and obtained
during the operation, the method of completely obliterating every space
in which blood clot or serum could accumulate would do away with
the necessity for drainage. This granted, it follows, as a natural
sequence, that absorbent dressings are superfluous, simple protection
of the line of suturing from atmospheric influences, infection, etc.,
being alone indicated. The iodoform and collodion compound would
seem to fulfil this admirably. The method could scarcely find application
in large or deep wounds, particularly if the latter invaded planes
of dense connective tissue, fasciæ, etc. Here it would be manifestly
best to provide drainage, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>In marked contrast to K’s method is that of McBurney, who, providing
against infiltration by suturing the entire thickness of each edge
of the wound together in such a manner as to render it practically but
one layer, packs the wound cavity, and thus obliterates the inguinal
canal, the latter filling up by granulation, a firm cicatricial plug taking
its place.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE TREATMENT OF CAROTID HÆMORRHAGE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Frederick Treves (<cite>The Lancet</cite>, January 21, 1888). In the neck,
pressure upon the carotid artery, in hæmorrhages from the branches
of that vessel, cannot be applied in the ordinary way with success,
nor could it be maintained for a sufficient length of time, if the pressure
succeeded in arresting the hæmorrhage, to be of service. Treves
proposes, however, to occlude the vessel temporarily by throwing a
broad piece of catgut around it, tying it in a loose loop, and then
making traction upon the same. The circulation through the vessel is
at once arrested, but can be at once restored upon relaxing the tension
upon the loop. He relates four cases in which the method proved
successful, so far as the arrest of the bleeding was concerned. One of
the patients succumbed to the great loss of blood sustained prior to
the application of the ligature, although the other carotid had been previously
tied. In the first case the loop remained <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> for four days.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The second case was the fatal one. In the third and fourth cases the
loop was removed on the seventh day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The method is based upon the fact that temporary arrest of the circulation
in certain cases of hæmorrhage from the limbs, where ordinary
means may be employed to exercise pressure, are quite sufficient,
not only for the purposes of a temporary expedient, but also seems as
a curative measure. This temporary modification of the blood current
may be all that is required in many instances. Just how long the blood
current may need to be checked, must be carefully studied in each
individual case. The thought occurs to us, however, that some risk
may be run of setting up an ulcerative action in the vessel walls by the
prolonged application of a loose ligature, upon which must be exercised
an intermittent pressure, by the pulsation of the vessel itself.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>ARTIFICIAL AID IN THE FORMATION OF CALLUS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prof. Helferich (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv. f. Klinische Chirurgie, Band 36, 4. Heft,
1888</span>). In cases of delayed union, and even in normal cases, to hasten
the natural process of repair, H. advises the application of an elastic
rubber bandage in such a manner as to retard the return flow of venous
blood, by this means favoring an increased amount of pabulum to
the field of repair, thus indirectly augmenting the formation of callus.
The patient must be taught to regulate the pressure, attention being
directed to the condition of the nails, in order that the bandage may
be adjusted to suit the varying condition of congestion present. Œdema
may be controlled by the application of a flannel bandage to that
portion of the limb below the site of fracture. It is claimed that by
this method the cure, in normal cases even, is considerably shortened.
The process of repair is hastened by keeping the limb in a dependent
position. The presence of small erosions at the site of fracture is not
a contra-indication to the use of the elastic band. The time of application
is of some importance, a too early application leading to too
active hyperæmia; while, on the other hand, if too long delayed,
the period of time in which the action will take place has passed.
In wired compound fractures and in resections, pressure may be applied
in from five to fourteen days after the operation, providing inflammatory
symptoms are absent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thomas, of Liverpool, has recommended a procedure, which is
known as the percussion method, to hasten the repair in delayed bony
union, in cases of imperfect union, and in ununited fractures. This
consists of percussing, once in a day or two, the site of the injury with
a small copper hammer for five minutes or more, and subsequently
bandaging the parts firmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is suggested that the formation of varicose veins may be an objection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>to the method of Helferich. Further, it is quite clear that the
method is not to be thought of in tuberculous subjects, as well as in
cases of large open wounds at the site of fracture, or where a gap is left
by resection of bone, removal of tumors, etc. The question of its
applicability to atrophic members is an open one.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>COMMUNICATION OF TUBERCULOSIS BY RITUAL CIRCUMCISION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>F. S. Eve (<cite>The Lancet</cite>, January 28th, 1888), relates the case of a Jewish
child, in whom, six weeks following the usual rite, a small swelling
appeared in each groin. They were found to be filled with caseous material,
which, upon being inoculated beneath the skin of guinea pigs,
gave rise to tuberculosis in the latter. The “Mohl,” or person
performing the rite, had ejected some wine from his mouth over the cut
surfaces of the prepuce. It was subsequently learned that this person
had died of pulmonary consumption shortly afterwards. Another
child in the same house, operated upon by the same person, suffered
from the same infection. Both children finally recovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Similar experiences have been recorded by Eisenberg (Berlin Med.
Woch., No. 35, 1886), and Meyer (Centralblatt f. Chirurgie, No. 46,
1887). Of greater importance, because of a probably greater frequency,
is the transmission of syphilis in this manner. A group of cases of this
kind were recently collected and made the subject of study at the London
Hospital.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>TRANSPLANTATION OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Baratoux and Dubonsquet (Progres. Med., No. 15, 1887). D.
treated two extensive wounds caused by burning, in which no attempt
at cicatrization seems to have been made, although granulation was
progressing well, by transplantation. Simultaneous auto-transplantation,
and pieces of skin from a frog’s back the size of a thumb-nail, was
practiced. Most of the latter lost their pigmented aspect after ten
days, and adhered well, taking on the natural color of the human
skin. The wound where the frog’s-skin transplantation had been performed
healed more rapidly than the other where human skin was
used, the cicatrix being softer as well. B. treated cases of ulceration
of the nose, and also perforations of the membrana tympani, successfully
by transplantation of frog’s skin, healing taking place in from
one to two weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>In three old cases of perforation of the drum membrane, the margins
were freshened by touching them with nitrate of silver, and a piece
of frog’s skin attached. In three days a cicatrix had formed, with considerable
improvement in the hearing. Transplantation must be practiced
with a healthy granulating wound, hæmorrhage being avoided.
According to the authors, the wound should be irrigated with a strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>solution of carbolic acid, and dried; the pieces of skin should also be
washed in a weak solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>It suggests itself to the abstractor that still better results would be
obtained by substituting a sterilized solution of chloride of sodium, say
of the strength of 6 to 1,000, for the strong carbolic solution recommended,
to be used just prior to the operation. The changes produced
in the vessels and their contained blood by the use of strong disinfecting
solutions are calculated to prevent early adhesion of the new skin.
At least such is the general experience of recent observers. Reliable
disinfection of the ulcerated surface may be obtained by keeping the
parts covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 to 12,000 solution of potassio-mercuric
iodide for a day or two previously.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE IMPROVED CÆSAREAN SECTION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Garrigues (Am. J. M. S., May, 1888,) describes in detail a successful
case of Cæsarean section with observations on the <em>technique</em> of
the improved operation. He prefers a long abdominal incision, and
eventration of the uterus before opening it, the advantage claimed
being the easier application of the rubber constrictor. The constrictor
is more manageable if held in the hand of the assistant instead
of the clamp, since it can be loosened and tightened as required.
To prevent prolapse of intestines he sutures the upper end of the abdominal
incision before turning out the uterus, tying the sutures before
that organ is opened. Extraction of the fœtus by the head is much
easier than by the feet. When a long uterine incision is required,
it is better to go an inch into the fundus than to extend the wound
into the lower segment, which may cause troublesome hæmorrhage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Removal of the ovaries for the prevention of subsequent pregnancies
he thinks not justified. The omentum he pushes up above the
uterus to prevent adhesions to the suture line and the consequent
danger of subsequent intestinal obstruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Garrigues believes Cæsarean section safer than <em>difficult</em> extraction
through the natural passages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleven Cæsarean sections were done in this country between December
16, 1886, and February 24, 1888, (Dr. R. P. Harris) all by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the improved method but one. Six women and eight children were
saved. Six of the operations were performed in hospitals, saving five
women; five in private practice, saving only one. All the five hospital
cases operated by the improved technique were successful. The bad
results in private practice Dr. G. ascribes to imperfect antisepsis. He
alludes to the tardy adoption by our own countrymen of the antiseptic
methods in general obstetric practice which have met with almost universal
acceptance elsewhere—in Germany midwives being even compelled
by law to use antiseptic precautions in every case of confinement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Including the above-mentioned case, one hundred and sixty-three
Cæsarean sections had thus far been done in the United States (Harris).
One hundred and seventy to date of this writing.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

<p class='c014'>The paper concludes with a detailed statement of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> and
after-treatment in the modern Cæsarean operation. (A loop of the
constrictor can usually be readily passed over the fundus and slipped
down to the cervix while the uterus is still in the abdomen as we have
shown.) (A Case of Cæsarean Section, N. Y. M. J., August 29, 1885.)
Traction upon the constrictor perfectly occludes the short abdominal
wound during the incision of the uterus, eventration taking place as
the uterus collapses on removing the fœtus. The advantage, therefore,
of extending the abdominal incision some inches above the umbilicus
in all cases and turning out the uterus before opening it may be doubted.
It is sometimes, however, impossible or difficult to apply the constrictor
to the uterus in situ. Extraction of the fœtus by the head is certainly
easier than delivery by the feet as advised by most writers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The comparative results of induced labor, version, perforation and
Cæsarean section in the Dresden Clinic have been recently considered
in a series of papers by Leopold and his assistants, Korn, Lohman and
Praeger.</p>

<p class='c009'>The maternal mortality was as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Leopold concludes that while Cæsarean section cannot yet be substituted
in all cases for craniotomy, it is at least justifiable as an alternative
when the following conditions are present or possible, viz.:</p>

<p class='c009'>Complete asepsis.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>The patient strong and not long in labor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fœtal heart-beats normal in rate and rhythm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strauch (Arch. f. Gyn.), analyzing the results in twenty-eight cases
of induced premature labor arrives at like conclusions. While the
mortality in cases of the mothers was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil</span></i>, the fœtal mortality was fifty-five
per cent. The rights of the fœtus demand a more frequent choice
of Cæsarean section, the mortality of which by the modern method is
thus far 11.8 per cent. for the mothers and 8 per cent. for the children.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Felice La Torre, of Paris, reaches the conclusion from extensive
clinical research that craniotomy or premature labor is better than
Cæsarean section, since the former saves all the mothers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Krassowski (Arch. f. Gyn., B. 32 H. 2) reports five Porro and two
Saenger operations saving six mothers and five children. K. uses
thymol 1:1,000 for instruments, and the biniodide of mercury 1:4,000
for the hands, etc. He seals the abdominal wound with collodion to
which biniodide of mercury has been added.</p>

<p class='c009'>Zweifel reports six additional cases of the Cæsarean operation after
Saenger, saving five mothers and all the children.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>THE MECHANISM OF LABOR IN HEAD PRESENTATION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Sutugin (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sammlung Klin. Vorträge, No. 310</span>) makes an important
contribution to the knowledge of this subject. The paper deals with
an “almost wholly neglected factor in the mechanism of labor,”
namely, the position of the fœtal trunk in utero, the mechanism of the
trunk movements and their effect upon the positions of the head during
labor. He first shows that the views commonly accepted with reference
to the position of the fœtal trunk during pregnancy are in part erroneous.
Observations by the author in six hundred and sixty cases,
published in 1875, established the fact that before labor, in either
right or left positions, the dorsum of the child is almost invariably
turned to the mother’s back, the vertebral column of fœtus, as a rule,
lying but little to one side or the other of the spinal column of the
mother; and, furthermore, the changes of position during pregnancy,
as from right to left, probably take place by rotation along the posterior
wall of the uterus. On the occurrence of energetic uterine contractions,
especially at the beginning of labor, the back of the child is
sometimes rotated to the mother’s side. Kehrer has confirmed the
conclusions of Sutugin in observations upon certain of the lower
animals. It may be noted in passing that, according to Kehrer’s
observations, gravity is a subordinate factor in determining the attitude
of the fœtus in utero.</p>

<p class='c009'>The author of the paper declares that, in a large number of cases
examined during the last twelve years he has not in a single instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>found the back of the child turned wholly forward during pregnancy,
not even in first positions of the head. He has more recently made a
study of the varying positions of the trunk during labor. Early in
the labor, in first positions of the head, the trunk rotates so that the
back of the child looks sideways, the shoulders lying in a plane parallel
with the introitus. The breech rotates more slowly than the
shoulders, the spinal column of the child thus assuming the form of a
spiral during delivery. The fœtus, therefore, in its descent moves in a
screw-like direction around its own axis, but the back of the child is
not turned forward even during parturition, as authors generally have
assumed. These views are born out by the frozen sections of Chiara,
Waldeyer, and Shroeder. The rotation of the head is in part due to the
rotation of the trunk, “the torsion of the axis of the fœtus,” and is
not to be referred solely to the action of the pelvic planes. The author
claims that a torsion of the uterus upon its axis similar to that of
the child also occurs. With reference to the etiology of the torsion
in case of uterus or fœtus, he ventures no explanation.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>MANAGEMENT OF THE PLACENTAL STAGE OF LABOR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Fehling (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sammlung Klin. Vorträge, No. 308</span>) compares the views
and practice of authorities in the treatment of the third stage of labor.
The various methods of placental delivery that have been advocated by
different writers are recounted. The reaction against Credé in favor of
expectancy, first started by Dohrn and Ahlfeld, has resulted in proving
the inferiority of the latter plan, and in a return to more active methods.
In a large number of German clinics, the uterus is allowed to rest immediately
after the expulsion of the child, without friction. When the placenta
lies detached in the lower uterine segment, which is generally the
case after fifteen or twenty minutes, nothing is to be gained by longer waiting.
The author is favorably disposed toward the practice of Credé,
which as he says, has never been shown by its adversaries to be capable
of harm when properly conducted. With reference to the mechanism
of placental separation, both theoretical considerations and clinical
observations favor the views of Duncan, yet the question is not settled.
Retained membranes may be removed with the aseptic hand. Yet
Credé and Olshausen consider the retention of even the whole chorion
free from danger, and clinical experience has shown better results by
the expectant plan in case of retained membranes than by interference.
These results, the author thinks, in the light of Döderlein’s researches,
are explained by the fact that the hand may transport the peccant
germs from the vagina into the uterus. The active plan, with a preliminary
vaginal disinfection and a vigorous asepsis throughout, should
yield better results than expectation.  Interference with these precautions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>is, at least, justified in case of atony and hæmorrhage or fever,
including, if need be, the use of the curette and subsequently ergot.
Dührssen’s method of tamponing the uterus in post-partum hæmorrhage
with iodoform gauze is favorably mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the event of cervical tears causing troublesome hæmorrhage,
Kaltenbach, Schroeder and Leopold practice immediate suture. The
author thinks the vaginal tamponade is generally to be preferred. Yet,
in certain cases the suture may also be required, or the application of
the perchloride of iron on cotton pledgets to the bleeding surfaces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Credé (Arch. f. Gyn., B. 32, H. 1) again discusses and defends his
method of managing the placental delivery which he prefers to call the
external method.</p>

<p class='c009'>The duration of the third stage need not in the majority of normal
labors exceed fifteen to thirty minutes. In many instances a more expectant
plan of treatment is better. In occasional cases more rapid
delivery is demanded in the interest of the mother. Since the method
is free from danger when properly conducted, the expulsion of the
placenta may be hastened within reasonable limits if for no other purpose
than to save the time of the attendants and to spare the sufferings
of the patient. He claims that the amount of blood-loss is diminished
under his treatment of the placental stage, and that the membranes are
not more frequently retained. Furthermore, he believes the retention
of portions of the membranes or placenta to be harmless in an
aseptic condition of the passages.</p>

<p class='c009'>The method of Credé, briefly restated, is as follows: First apply
gentle, painless friction in a circular direction over the anterior wall of
the uterus, laying the hand flat upon the abdomen. Bring the axis of
the uterus in conformity with the axis of the pelvic inlet. If the placenta
is not expelled after three or four pains assist the next contraction,
at its acme only, by compressing the upper segment, grasping the
fundus with the thumb in front and the fingers behind, at the same
time using gentle downward pressure. Use slight friction only but no
compression during the intervals between the pains nor even during the
contraction except at its height. Success usually attends the eighth or
tenth pain.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>SCARLET FEVER: ITS RELATION TO PUERPERAL FEVER</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boxall (Br. Gyn. J.) in sixteen cases of scarlet fever in childbed
found septic manifestations in but one. In forty lying-in patients exposed
to the scarlatinal poison the puerperium was entirely normal.
Three hundred patients or more were admitted to the hospital during
the epidemic of scarlatina therein, yet a comparison of the morbidity
during this time with that which immediately preceded the outbreak
showed that the prevalence of scarlet fever in the hospital exerted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>no appreciable effect upon the course of the puerperium in patients
who escaped scarlatina.</p>

<p class='c009'>Galabin (Br. M. J.) thinks there is strong evidence of the bacterial
relation of puerperal sepsis to scarlet fever. Septicæmia does not represent
a distinct entity like scarlatina. Cheyne found the common
microbes of suppuration in the blood of scarlet fever patients not
infrequently.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>MITRAL STENOSIS AND THE THIRD STAGE OF LABOR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dr. D. B. Hart (E. M. J., Feb. 1888,) reports eight cases of this complication
with seven deaths. With reference to the etiology Dr. Hart thinks
the progress of the cardiac lesion is greatly accelerated by the increased
amount of work imposed upon the crippled heart during pregnancy.
At the beginning of labor, therefore, we may get failure of compensation,
dilated heart and engorgement of the lungs. At the close of the
labor, if free hæmorrhage does not occur, the extra blood before
accommodated in the utero-placental sinuses is returned to the right
heart. Death is therefore liable to occur in the third stage from over
distention of the right heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Ballantyne (E. M. J., March, 1888,) adds two more cases to
the above record, both terminating fatally. Sphygmograms obtained
in these cases show that the period immediately following the expulsion
of the placenta is the one of greatest danger, and they are entirely
consistent with Hart’s theory of the cause of death.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>TREATMENT OF ABORTION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Fry (Am. Obs. J., June, 1888,) advocates the use of the galvanic
current as a substitute for the curette for the removal of retained
fragments of the secundines. He uses a current of sixty to ninety
milliamperes with the anode in the uterus. The application is
continued from six to ten minutes and repeated on alternate
days. The placental tissue, owing to its relatively low vitality, is
destroyed without injury to the uterus itself. Separation and expulsion
follow. Hæmorrhage is relieved by the well known hæmostatic action
of the positive electrode. Dr. Fry also claims antiseptic properties for
the positive pole since here are liberated oxygen and chlorine in a
nascent state and also acids.</p>

<p class='c009'>Goodell thinks the curette an inefficient instrument for the evacuation
of the uterine cavity and liable to injure the uterus. He advocates
polypus forceps. Parrish finds the curette deceptive. He uses the
finger. Longaker prefers the finger. [A Sims’ speculum, a dull
curette and a strong, straight uterine dressing forceps, with its joint
two and a half inches from its distal end need never fail. The
finger is awkward, difficult, painful, and sometimes requires preliminary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>dilation of the cervix. It cannot, moreover, be so easily sterilized,
and even though clean primarily is liable to carry septic organisms
from the vagina. Injuries to the uterus are for the most part the fault
of imperfect asepsis.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>PLACENTA PRÆVIA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Obermann (Arch. f. Gyn., B. 32 H. 1.) discusses the treatment
of placenta prævia by version with the results obtained in sixty-four
cases at the Leipsic clinic. The method, which has become known as
Hofmeier’s method, he states as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Perform bimanual version with deliberate extraction in case of much
hæmorrhage. The podalic extremity of the child makes an effectual
tampon. Massage of the uterus during extraction is advised to aid
expulsion. Iodoform gauze tampon may be used in case of hæmorrhage
in the early months. The colpeurynter is recommended in
case of hæmorrhage with a closed cervix. Alcoholic stimulants are
given early and often.</p>

<p class='c009'>The results in the sixty-four cases were eighty-nine per cent. of the
mothers and forty-seven per cent. of the children saved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nordmann, of Dresden, condemns early resort to operative procedures
as a routine measure, a more expectant plan of treatment
being competent in a certain proportion of cases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Robt. Barnes (Br. Med. Jour., March 3d, 1887) sums up his views
substantially as follows: The hæmorrhage in placenta prævia proceeds
from so much of the lower zone of the uterus as is laid bare by
separation of the placenta during canalization. This comprises all
that portion of the uterus that lies below the equator of the fœtal head.
When canalization is complete the hæmorrhage is almost invariably
arrested spontaneously by retraction of the lower zone thus freed. Until
canalization is completed flooding is liable to persist, but after that
process is accomplished the case becomes practically a natural labor.
The too prevalent idea that the hæmorrhage is unavoidable and must
go on till delivery is erroneous and mischievous. Enough placental
attachment usually remains after complete dilatation to preserve the
life of the child. The fœtal life is not necessarily compromised except
in certain extreme cases of complete central placenta prævia. His
views of treatment follow as a corollary. Expedite the first stage,
avoiding violence or precipitation. His caoutchouc bags accomplish
this indication and control hæmorrhage. Detach the placenta with the
finger from the zone below the equator of the head, thus permitting
retraction and arrest of flooding. Rupture of the membranes and the
use of the binder meet the indications in certain cases. The vaginal
plug may be used in occasional instances if carefully watched. The os
uteri moderately expanded and the placenta separated from the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>zone, hæmorrhage having ceased, wait. With sufficient dilatation,
deliver, if necessary, by forceps, version, or craniotomy. Dr. Murphy’s
success by this plan has been unexampled. [Dr. Barnes does injustice
to version in placenta prævia, since he appears to assume that immediate
extraction and violence to both mother and child are a necessary
part of the procedure. The success of that plan he attributes in great
part to the fact that, in carrying out the operation of turning, the placenta
had probably been detached from the lower zone. These criticisms
certainly cannot apply in case of external or bipolar version.
With reference to Barnes’ bags, it is safe to say, “the German teachers”
are not the only practitioners who have found them, in many cases,
more or less impracticable.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>OBSTETRIC SEPSIS AND ANTISEPSIS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Auvard, writing to the Annals of Gynec., April, 1888, says, while
before the days of antiseptics it was better for a woman to be delivered
in the street than in a hospital, the hospital ward is now less dangerous
than the isolated lying-in chamber of the out-patient obstetric service.
He points out the importance of improving the resisting power by
use of tonics before the labor, in debilitated patients. In Auvard’s
practice every woman takes a thorough bath at the beginning of
labor. The whole vulvar and vaginal surfaces and cervical canal are
sterilized before expulsion begins, before obstetric wounds are developed.
Asepsis before and during the birth is more effectual than the use of
antiseptics at the close of labor and renders the latter unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sublimate soap and the sublimate solution, with which this soap
makes a lather, are well rubbed into the surfaces to be cleansed by aid
of the fingers. The dangers of sublimate poisoning do not obtain
while the surfaces are intact.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the event of septic developments during the puerperal period
he thinks sublimate irrigation insufficient for genital antisepsis. The
vulva and vagina should be scrubbed by aid of the fingers with the
sublimate soap and solution. The uterus should be scraped with the
curette. Auvard has devised for this purpose a curette with a hollow
stem through which a stream of the antiseptic solution is kept flowing
during its use. [The mercurial salts may be replaced with a 1:1000
hydronaphthol solution for use within the passages after labor, though
the danger from the former antiseptic may be greatly diminished by
washing away the mercurial with a final injection of plain boiled
water.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>AUTO-INFECTION IN CHILDBED.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Ahlfeld (Cent. f. Gyn., No. 52,) shows that it is not always safe
to presume upon the impossibility of self-infection, and reports two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>cases in point. In rare cases infection may arise from organisms primarily
present in the genitalia. [This goes to fortify Auvard’s position.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>OCCURRENCE OF GERMS IN THE DISCHARGES FROM THE UTERUS AND VAGINA DURING THE PUERPERAL PERIOD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Döderlein (Arch. f. Gyn., B. xxxi., H. 3,) finds in a series of carefully
conducted observations, that in normal cases the uterine discharges
contain no germs, while in the same patients numerous
varieties of germ life abound in the vagina. Pathogenic organisms
may occur in the vagina apart from any internal examination.
These germs may gain access to the uterus of themselves when not
carried by intra-uterine instrumentation or manipulation. These conclusions
are confirmed by Kaltenbach.</p>

<p class='c009'>The uterine lochia of women suffering from puerperal sepsis in any
form invariably contain germs, the streptococcus pyogenes being constantly
present.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>SUBLIMATE SOLUTION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Laplace has shown the importance of acidulating sublimate solutions
for general antiseptic use. Neutral solutions on mingling with
blood or other albuminous fluids become more or less inert by the
precipitation of the albuminate of mercury. That precipitate is
not formed in the presence of hydrochloric or tartaric acids. The
proportion for sterilizing wounds should be five parts of the acid to
one of the sublimate in one thousand of water. [Biniodide solutions
require no acid. This is one of the many advantages of the mercuric
iodide over the bichloride for antiseptic use. In a series of experiments
made for the purpose of determining the reaction of biniodide
solutions on albuminous fluids we found that neutral solutions of the
biniodide of mercury yield no precipitate with albuminous fluids. No
reaction was obtained with a biniodide solution acidulated with hydrochloric
acid in the proportion of five parts to the thousand. The
addition of organic acids, such as acetic, citric or tartaric, as is well
known, causes a precipitate of albuminate of mercury. There is no
chemical incompatibility between sublimate soap and biniodide solutions.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>TRICHLORIDE OF IODINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>One of the new antiseptic agents is iodine trichloride. In contact
with organic bodies it gives off iodine and chlorine in the nascent
state. The final products, moreover, hydrochloric and iodic
acids, are well known oxidizing agents. The strength of solution used
is one part in 1,000 or one in 500 parts of water. Such a solution
is equivalent in sterilizing power to a 1:1,000 or 2,000 sublimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>solution. [One disadvantage of this antiseptic is the powerful
corrosive action of nascent chlorine and iodine upon metal instruments.]</p>

<h4 class='c012'>DANGERS OF ANTISEPTICS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Senger (Br. M. J., May 19, 1888,) has proved by experiments
on dogs and rabbits that the antiseptic agents commonly employed
are liable to cause degeneration of the kidneys. He injected
into perfectly healthy animals corrosive sublimate, carbolic acid,
etc., in one-twelfth the quantity necessary to kill them. Then
on extirpation of one kidney he found in all cases, on microscopical
examination, glomerulo-nephritis. He also found fatty degeneration
of the liver, spleen, the heart-muscle, etc. The various
antiseptic agents were found to be injurious in different degrees,
corrosive sublimate being the most dangerous, then the others in the
following order: iodoform, carbolic acid, salicylic acid, boric acid.
These observations especially enforce the importance of avoiding the
use of antiseptics in the abdominal cavity, or in other large cavities
under conditions favorable to absorption. Sterilized water or a five
per cent. chloride of sodium solution should be substituted for use in
the peritoneum. Senger has shown that the salt solution in no way
injures the organs, and that it possesses moderate antiseptic power,
killing the streptococcus pyogenes aureus in twenty-eight minutes.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>EFFECT OF ERGOT ON THE INVOLUTION OF THE UTERUS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Drs. G. G. Herman and C. O. Fowler (Br. M. J., Feb. 11, 1888,) discuss
this question, basing their conclusions on the results noted in fifty-eight
cases treated with ergot for a fortnight after delivery, and sixty-eight
in which a single dose only of ergot was given at the close of labor. In
the cases continuously ergotized the diminution of the uterus in size
was more rapid than in those who received but a single dose. On the
duration of the lochial discharge no appreciable effect was observed
from the use of ergot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Boxall has made similar observations on two parallel series of
cases of one hundred each. Every alternate patient was given a mixture
containing ext. ergot. ammon., ♏︎ xv., t.i.d., during the first three days
after labor. Dr. B. concludes from the experience of these cases that
the practice of giving ergot as described tends to prevent the formation
of clots, to hasten their expulsion, and to diminish the frequency,
intensity and duration of after-pains. That if omitted at first and given
afterwards ergot tends to promote the expulsion of clots and to relieve
after-pains.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>ANÆSTHESIA WITH CHLOROFORM AND OXYGEN.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Kreutzmann (Cent. f. Gyn.) recommends a mixture of oxygen
and chloroform vapors as an anæsthetic in obstetric and surgical
practice. The mixture may be made by passing freshly prepared and
pure oxygen through chloroform on its way to the inhaler. Neudörfer
injects a small quantity of chloroform into a balloon filled with oxygen,
administering through a face piece. It is claimed for this method,
that anæsthesia is at once established after a few deep inspirations
without the least excitement, and that there are no disagreeable
after-effects, the patient awaking promptly on ceasing the anæsthetic
as from a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Veit, of Berlin, has operated in seven cases of tubal pregnancy before

<p class='c009'>Breisky, of Vienna, has recently performed the first successful laparotomy
for the removal of an ectopic viable fœtus in which all the
fœtal appendages were at the same time removed. The operation was
done at the end of the eighth month. Breisky advocates primary laparotomy
with extirpation of the entire sac in preference to the secondary
operation.</p>

<p class='c009'>A second edition of this work has just been issued and, as the
author says, has been enlarged. It contains 791 pages including the
index; and is divided into four main parts, the first part treating of
the brain; 2d, the cranial nerves; 3d, the spinal cord; 4th, the spinal
nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is very difficult to give a review of a work like this, which treats
so largely of the anatomy of the nervous system; and which is the
most difficult part of anatomy, and a great deal of which is not positively
settled, but is under sharp discussion by those who pay special
attention to the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work is a more or less successful compilation, which is prepared
with the idea of its being used as a text-book. Its size indicates
that it contains an enormous quantity of material on the gross and fine
anatomy, but excursions are also made into the domain of medicine
to illustrate the application of the anatomical knowledge to the explanation
of symptoms in disease; and quite frequently physiology and
pathology are dealt with.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a text-book the work appears to me a great deal too large; and
the treatment of the subjects too diffuse; and often not clear; this is
especially so in the anatomical part. Cerebral anatomy is one of those
subjects of which it is very difficult to treat in a clear and comprehensive
manner so that others can understand it; and for this reason a
text-book should be small and contain only such anatomy as is clearly
made out and can be made practical use of as applied anatomy. The
finer anatomy and the study of the course of fibres, etc., should be
taken up as a special work, and studied with patience on specimens,
sections, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great many digressions into physiological questions might have
been left out, and some other subjects properly belonging to general
medicine, which the student could best study in some of the recent
works on diseases of the nervous system, or at the clinics. As an
illustration of what is meant, take, for instance, a consideration of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>tendon reflex on page 576, and the short imperfect sketch on page 621,
on progressive muscular atrophy, when on the next page is a figure of
a man, forty-five years old, with progressive muscular atrophy, from
Freidreich’s work; a case which, by the way, is probably not a case of
chronic myelitis of the anterior horns, but one of the cystrophies. The
subject of progressive muscular atrophies is now undergoing close
study, and a large number of cases are not dependent upon lesions of
the anterior horns, but are due to changes in the muscles themselves.
The work of Freidreich, Erb, Lichtheim, Ladaur, Charcot, Landonzy
and Dejeuni, and many others, have placed the subject in a different
light from that in which it was viewed some ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Subjects like these can be found more satisfactorily treated in other
works, and are altogether out of place in a book like this and only
adds to its bulk.</p>

<p class='c009'>The descriptions are often such as to confuse and mislead a
student; for instance, take the opening chapter on the brain, where
the author says: “In man and the vertebrates, the cerebro and spinal
axis may be divided into three separate portions, each perfectly independent
of one another and yet very intimately connected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this division is quite artificial, and is only for purposes of
description, and these parts are not <em>perfectly independent of one another</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, he says: “The nervous system of all animals may be subdivided
into two distinct histologic elements, nerve cells and nerve
fibres.” What has become of the neuroglia and neuroglia cells; are
they not important histologic elements in the nervous system of all
animals? Without this supporting framework what would become of
the nerve tubes and ganglion cells? And in many of the diseases of
the central nervous system this neuroglia takes on a very active condition,
as is seen in such a disease as disseminated cerebro and spinal
sclerosis.</p>

<p class='c009'>On page 45, in speaking of the study of sections of the cortex, the
author says: “By a judicious employment of gradually increasing
powers in the microscopic objectives used, the general arrangement of
the elements may be first mastered, and later on the minute details of
each of the component parts may be studied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This sounds like a most formidable and delicate task in the <em>judicious
employment</em> of objectives in increasing powers in the study of these
sections. No one should attempt to study the histology of the nervous
system without previously knowing something about the use of the
microscope and having some practical knowledge of general histology
and pathology; to such a person the study of sections does not depend
upon <em>the judicious employment of gradually increasing powers in the microscope
objectives</em>; if he use a No. 2 and a No. 7 of Verick, or some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>objective of about the same magnifying power, it is then simply a question
of studying the specimens with those powers and learning to see
and understand what he sees; there is no mystery about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will refer to one other paragraph on page 56, where it is stated:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The central gray matter of the spinal cord. This has no connection
with the higher senses. It is capable in itself of the simplest kind
of reflex acts by means of the spinal nerves. These can be produced
at the will of the experimenter, in the beheaded frog, when an irritation
of the skin by an acid, etc., is created; and Robin has satisfactorily
performed the same experiment upon a beheaded criminal. We have
reason to believe that the spinal cord can be slowly and in a purely
automatic way taught to perform certain series of muscular movements
(as in playing scales upon a musical instrument, for example,) without
any intervention of the higher ganglia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is physiology. Is it true that the central gray matter of the
spinal cord has no connection with the higher senses? The complicated
movements which are performed by a person playing on a
musical instrument, like the piano, for instance, are more than a
simple reflex action of the spinal cord; and we do not believe that the
spinal cord can be taught to perform such movements without the
intervention of the higher ganglia. When one is learning to play the
piano or other musical instrument, the higher centres are constantly in
action, guiding and regulating the muscular contractions which go to
make up the act of playing; after constant repetition under the guidance
of the higher centres, the spinal cord and lower centres, as it
were, learn and retain the combinations necessary to the performance
of the act, all that is necessary is to start the particular combination,
and the spinal cord will carry it on automatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spinal cord cannot be taught to perform such complicated
acts without the intervention and guidance of the higher centres to
begin with.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Ranney has done a great deal of work in the preparation of
this volume, and deserves much credit for his endeavors to collect this
somewhat scattered material.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work has numerous illustrations and diagrams, most of them
exceedingly good, but we observe among them some of the worthless
and often fanciful illustrations from Luys’, which are reproduced here.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>DR. J. B. MATTISON.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Mattison recently spent several weeks in Bermuda, and the
<cite>British Med. Journal</cite> in reporting a meeting of the British Med. Association,
held in the Town Hall at Hamilton, says:</p>

<p class='c009'>By request of the Society, Dr. J. B. Mattison, of Brooklyn, gave an
address on the subject of narcotic inebriety. Attention was called to
the extensive use of opium, chloral, and cocaine, notably in France,
Germany and America. The genesis of the disease was a physical
necessity in many cases. The speaker said in proper cases his plan—an
original one—was to secure an entire narcotic disuse by regular
reduction, in ten days, meantime bringing the nervous system under
the sedative influence of bromide of sodium, in initial doses of thirty
grains, at twelve-hour intervals, increasing the dose ten grains daily,
and reaching, if required, a maximum of one hundred and twenty
grains at the end of the withdrawal period. The resultant reflex irritation
was treated by hot baths, cannabis indica, hyoscyamus, coca,
and electricity, with a subsequent tonic regime. The prognosis was
good as to recovery, but in most cases, sooner or later, there was a
return to the narcotic, due to a renewal of the original cause, or to
other conditions beyond control. A vote of thanks to Dr. Mattison
closed the meeting.</p>

    <div class='c003'>The Era Prize Essay.—Reprint from the Pharmaceutical Era.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Originally every physician was his own apothecary, and at the present
time probably a majority of medical practitioners dispense their
own medicines, very rarely writing a prescription. These will have
but a languid interest in the subject of this essay, which deeply concerns
all physicians who are not their own apothecaries, and all compounding
pharmacists.</p>

<p class='c009'>In medical, as in every other science, the increase of knowledge so
widened the field that it became impossible for one mind to grasp all
the facts, and a division of labor took place, the part of the work
which related to the collection, preservation and dispensing of drugs
being assigned to a class of men who had displayed peculiar aptitude
for that branch. Thus was constituted as a distinct occupation, the
specialty of the apothecary, which, beginning as a department of medical
science, is inherently honorable, and has been so developed that
it gives scope for a lifetime of fascinating research, elevating study, and
profitable endeavor, independently of any proper work of the modern
physician. The two callings are, for the purposes of this discussion,
as in their best actual operation, practically distinct; and yet they are
not independent, but interdependent. The greater part of the physician’s
labor would be vainly spent, were it not supplemented by the
service of the pharmacist; the latter’s business would cease to have a
reason for existence but for the vocation of the former.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this paper it will be taken for granted that the physician is well
educated and experienced in his profession, that the apothecary knows
his business thoroughly, and that both are actuated by high moral
purposes. The grievance of neither, therefore, will result from the
intentional wrong-doing of the other, but from his thoughtlessness or
conservative adherence to long-established custom. The honesty of
each being presupposed, such a charge as the substitution of an inferior
article for some ingredient in a prescription, or the false insinuation
that a mistake in the medicine is due to the compounder’s carelessness
need not be raised. Let us consider the grievances of each against the

<p class='c009'>The physician complains that the apothecary exceeds his function by
prescribing for the sick. A person applies to the pharmacist for a remedy
for a specified disease. The latter consults the dispensatory, finds a number
of medicines mentioned in the therapeutical index under the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>that malady, selects one, and sells the article to the patient. He regards
the protest of the doctor merely as the wail of one who is disappointed
at not getting a fee for prescribing. The physician has a right to complain
of those who prescribe for any but the indigent without a professional
fee, for this makes it vastly harder for him to collect the charges
to which he is entitled; but he has higher ground than this. With
him the first step in every case of disease is diagnosis, without which
prescribing is simply drawing a bow at a venture, with small probability
of penetrating a joint of the harness; and he insists that neither
the apothecary nor the patient is qualified to make a diagnosis. The
determination of the character of a disease is not a simple matter, often
baffling the profoundest learning and the broadest experience, and, in
most cases, requiring special knowledge and discriminating judgment.
The most obtrusive symptoms are by no means necessarily the most
characteristic; a given symptom may be the accompaniment of different
diseases, and sometimes attends pathological changes of diametrically
opposite nature. But one who is uninstructed in this branch has
nothing but symptoms to guide him, and therefore frequently, if not
commonly, is led into error, which may produce the gravest results.
The educated physician is the only person who is equipped to solve
the problems of disease; and it is, in the long run, cheapest, even
from the financial point of view, for one who is ill to obtain competent
medical advice. Therefore, considering merely the welfare of the
patient, the physician deplores the custom of counter-prescribing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The universal practice among apothecaries of refilling prescriptions
indefinitely, without the sanction of those who wrote them is frequently
the subject of adverse criticism by physicians. “But,” says the pharmacist,
“is not the prescription mine?” Probably the reply will be
affirmative, though this is a question not entirely settled in the minds
of those concerned. Granting, however, for the sake of the argument,
that the apothecary is the rightful owner of the prescription, he triumphantly
asks, “May not one do as he chooses with his own?” Not
always, by any means, unless he elects to use his property in a way
which will not imperil the welfare of others. The law puts many
restrictions on the natural rights of ownership, for the purpose of
shielding society from the ignorance, the malice, and the cupidity of
proprietors. In the matter of prescriptions there are no such limitations;
but in this, as in so many other affairs, we should be controlled
not merely by considerations concerning our legal rights. The unwritten,
but greater, law regards the question from a higher plane;
and from this point of view one sees that there are moral reasons which
should restrain the apothecary in these premises. Let us look at
prescription-refilling in its remote as well as its immediate bearings.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The physician writes his prescription for one occasion and for one
only. He designs it to fulfil the indications in a particular case at a
given visit. It is often in the highest degree improbable that the conditions
of the case will remain the same for a given length of time;
and, when they change materially, another prescription is needed to
satisfy the altered requirements. Of these things many patients and
apparently, all apothecaries are accustomed to take no note; and,
therefore, the prescription is refilled for the same person on many
occasions, when something very different ought to be furnished, the
expected improvement does not occur, and the physician is blamed for
the failure. The prescription, intended for the treatment of a certain
condition afforded relief and changed the state of affairs. Thereupon,
further advice should have been sought by the patient, his physical
condition investigated anew, and another recipe given by the physician,
if he deemed it desirable. To hold the doctor responsible for the ill
effect or lack of effect of his prescription in circumstances unlike those
for which it was designed is obviously unjust. Yet this is done habitually,
both in the case just supposed and in those other instances, quite
as common, in which the recipe is compounded, not for whom it was
written, but for some other person, who supposes (on what slender
evidence it is appalling to contemplate), that his ailment is identical
with that of the original patient. The refilling really amounts to the
apothecary’s abetting the patient in self-treatment. There is a trite
remark to the effect that he who undertakes to be his own lawyer is
sure of a fool for a client. In legal actions the matters at stake mostly
relate to property; in medical affairs, health and life are involved.
Can anything better be said of the wisdom of him who, without adequate
training, undertakes to settle questions in which his very existence
is concerned, than of the sagacity of the man who, with no
competent knowledge of law and the methods of the courts, presumes
to manage a case in which merely a sum of money may be lost?</p>

<p class='c009'>But undesirable as is the custom of pharmacists in this respect, it is
unreasonable in physicians to grumble at it, until they reform a habit
of their own, which encourages the practice which they deprecate.
When a physician finds a sick man improving with a certain plan of
treatment, and wishes the same medication continued, usually he simply
tells the patient to have his bottle refilled at the apothecary’s. The
latter, knowing that this is the usage of the medical profession, is
accustomed to suppose—constructively, at least—that, when the bottle
is returned to be replenished, it is brought at the desire of the doctor;
and he again compounds the medicine, as he would not be justified in
doing, if the method of physicians was different. If the latter would
habitually rewrite their prescriptions, or indite orders for repetition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>whenever they wish a continuance of treatment, apothecaries would
have the best possible sanction for supplying medicines to patients a
second or a thousandth time, and would have no moral warrant for
such action without the written direction of the authors of the recipes.
When the doctors adopt the plan suggested, a violation of their request
that their prescriptions shall not be repeated without their written order
will furnish abundant ground for complaint; until such change of
method is established, the consistency of their protest does not conspicuously
appear. By the practice proposed, the apothecaries would
lose some business, indeed, but the community would experience an
immeasurable gain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sale of so-called patent medicines by pharmacists is a continual
irritant to doctors. Their objections have the same basis as in the preceding
case, namely, that apothecaries ought not to encourage the
people to prescribe for themselves. A distinguished physician once
said that drugs do more harm than good—a statement which will not
be disputed by those most conversant with the facts. But this is no
argument against the employment of medicinal remedies in any proper
way. Drugs taken by advice of educated, competent physicians do an
immense amount of good; the injury comes almost altogether from
their administration independently of the recommendation of qualified
medical men. Concocted, not to benefit humanity, but to enrich their
manufacturers, advertised as positive cures of diseases which the utmost
skill of the medical profession cannot control, sometimes inert, sometimes
dangerous from the poisons which they contain, pressed upon
the attention of the people with impudent persistence and colossal
mendacity, the infamous compounds, called patent medicines, are
purchased by the credulous public in almost incredible amounts.
Nobody knows as well as the pharmacist what quantities of drugs are
sold in this form; nobody knows as fully as the physician the enormously
baneful effects which they produce. If apothecaries would
refuse to handle this class of goods, they would confer a wonderful
blessing on humanity, by demonstrating their belief in the injuriousness
of these articles, and thus bringing them into disrepute; and they
would vastly dignify their profession by displaying its sense of moral
obligation, even at the sacrifice of a lucrative part of its business.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apothecaries complain that, to meet the demands of prescriptions,
they are obliged, at great expense, to keep in stock a large number of
whimsical preparations, and also many brands of the same standard
medicines, when really one is practically as eligible as another. There
is force in this complaint. As a rule, the former class of preparations
has but an ephemeral popularity, and, as for the latter, there cannot
often be need of specifying the goods of a particular manufacturer;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>for a worldly-wise, not to say honorable, pharmacist certainly may be
trusted to furnish only fine articles, that he may keep the favor of those
upon whose good-will his legitimate business depends. If a special
brand is deemed necessary by the doctor, he can request a convenient
apothecary to procure a quantity, and then can send to his shop the
patients who require this article. Thoughtful consideration of this
grievance will dictate some such course and effect its redress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Occasionally, in places where apothecaries are accessible, physicians
furnish their patients with medicines. This the pharmacist rightly
regards with disfavor, as diminishing his legitimate business. The
truly wise physician shuns this practice, perceiving that he cannot be
as competent a pharmacist as is one who is nothing else, and furthermore,
preferring to avoid the suspicion of administering medicines
unnecessarily for the purpose of making a profit on them. Enlightened
selfishness prompts him to encourage scientific pharmacy as a specialty.</p>

tube, extreme irritation of the mucous membrane of the bowel, and
obstructions caused by certain conditions of the uterus, the fœtal head,
or an enlarged prostate. As a rule, these lesions are to be found on
the anterior wall of the rectum, from one to seven centimetres from
the anus. They are not always easy to diagnose, as other foreign
bodies or caustics may produce similar appearances. Tubercular and
hæmorrhoidal ulcers may be mistaken for them; these are, however,
generally higher up. A perforating wound gives rise to paraproctitis,

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
